Hi siddharthavasam,

As part of our dedication to community-driven evaluation, we're excited to  
introduce Kaggle Game Arena. Here, top AI models compete head-to-head in  
strategic games, starting with chess.

Game Arena is designed to benchmark model performance in dynamic,  
interactive environments. You'll see how models like Gemini, Claude, and  
others handle real-time decision-making, strategic planning, and  
adaptation, all running on Kaggle. Visit kaggle.com/game-arena and learn  
more on our blog.

First up is an AI chess exhibition tournament in partnership with  
Chess.com, Take Take Take, and top players including Hikaru Nakamura, Levy  
Rozman, and Magnus Carlsen. Matchups will stream live August 5–7 at 10:30  
AM PT each day on kaggle.com/game-arena.

Each game has its own open-source environment and harness, with results  
published as live leaderboards on Kaggle Benchmarks. On August 7, we'll  
reveal the Chess Text Input leaderboard, the inaugural installment of the  
broader Game Arena, which combines rigorous scientific methodology with  
spectator-friendly excitement. Over time, Game Arena will expand to include  
more games, modalities, and evaluation setups.

Curious what your favorite models are capable of? Dive into the bracket or  
catch the action live at kaggle.com/game-arena.

Happy Kaggling,

Hi siddharthavasam,

The OpenAI to Z Hackathon proved what happens when thousands of Kagglers  
tackle a challenge with creativity, collaboration and data.

In this hackathon, over 8,000 Kagglers became modern-day digital explorers,  
using open data and AI models to uncover secrets of the Amazon rainforest  
and bring ancient legends to life. Some teams focused on predicting hidden  
archaeological sites, others experimented with new patterns in the data and  
a few surprised us with entirely new approaches to discovery.

There were more than 200 submissions, each representing a unique way to  
explore a complex problem. Hackathons like this aren't just about accuracy  
- they're about imagination, experimentation and collaboration. They create  
a portfolio of creative solutions, showing what's possible when communities  
come together to explore a challenge from different angles.

The winning teams and projects have been announced, but the creativity and  
insights from all participants continue to inspire. You can explore all the  
writeups from the participants to see the wide range of ideas and  
approaches.





Explore Writeups



Your digital exploration continues! Kaggle will keep offering new  
hackathons to test ideas, collaborate and discover what's possible together.

Happy Kaggling!

1989f35ad926a7cc,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,"57 proposals, 4 deals, 1 breakthrough","So a Maker School member recently shared their stats with me:

* 57 proposals sent
* 13 replies
* 4 deals closed
* $500 total revenue

He saw this and thought he was failing. So did everyone else.
$500 from 57 applications?

That’s a lot of work. For a small payoff.

But today, I’m going to reframe this for you. Because he’s
actually CRUSHING it. And I’ll show you why he’ll succeed
long-term.

Getting paid to learn
---------------------

This member (anonymous for privacy) isn’t really making $500.

He’s making more like $5,000.

You just can’t see all the earnings. Because he’s getting paid to
learn. For example, these are some of the skills he’s picking up:

* Selling clients
* Scoping projects
* Managing expectations
* Building 4 different automations
* Getting case studies, testimonials, and building his Upwork
profile
* Closing clients who very well may buy more things from him in
the future

Six months from now, when he’s pitching $3,000 systems instead of
$125 ones, he’ll have hands-on experience with real clients, a
portfolio of completed projects, and the confidence that he can
deliver.

Small wins build momentum.

So start stacking them.

Clear input-to-output equation
------------------------------

While everyone else is obsessing over individual deal sizes, he
figured out something more important: his input-to-output
equation.

Input: 57 Upwork proposals

Output: 4 paying clients

That's a 7% close rate from total proposals. He found an equation
that worked. And more importantly, one he can crank on.

Think about it.

If 57 proposals = 4 deals, then:

* 114 proposals = 8 deals
* 171 proposals = 12 deals
* 228 proposals = 16 deals

Same effort per proposal. Same skill level. Just volume
multiplication.

But the truth is, he’s going to get better at applications.
Better at landing clients. Better at charging high prices. So
those 16 deals might be worth $1,000 a piece, or $3,000 a piec",2025-08-12T16:55:50+00:00,promotion,low,0,,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,2025-08-12 16:55:50+00:00,2025-08-12

198f1ad35ec77d68,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The $4k Instagram system (AI finds your next clients),"Today’s Client Ready Workflow is perfect for anyone doing
Instagram outreach.

You’ll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it’s structured/how it works
* A template you can grab for free (and sell to your own clients)

Let’s dive in.

I built an AI-Powered Instagram Lead Generation System for a
social media agency. Their issue is they were spending 15+ hours
per week manually finding prospects on Instagram and crafting
personalized messages.

Result after working with them:

Reduced prospecting time from 15 hours to 30 minutes per week
while improving message personalization and response rates.

Here’s exactly how it works, why every agency needs this, and how
you can grab the templates for free.

-----------------------
The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

Here’s what every business doing Instagram outreach deals with:

* Manual prospect research takes forever: Finding potential
clients by manually scrolling through competitor followers
* Generic messages get ignored: Copy-paste DMs have terrible
response rates because they’re obviously automated
* Scaling kills personalization: The more prospects you contact,
the less personal each message becomes
* Data management nightmare: Keeping track of who you’ve
contacted, their details, and follow-up status

I built this system for a social media agency that was spending
their entire Monday and Tuesday manually researching Instagram
prospects and crafting personalized messages.

Some wild stats about Instagram outreach:

* Stat 1: Personalized messages get 6x higher response rates than
generic templates (Hootsuite)
* Stat 2: 71% of businesses use Instagram for lead generation,
but only 23% have it automated (Sprout Social)
* Stat 3: Manual Instagram prospecting takes an average of 12
minutes per qualified lead (Social Media Examiner)

What does this tell us? By automating Instagram prospecting with
AI personalization, you can dramatica",2025-08-28T17:15:15+00:00,promotion,low,0,,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,2025-08-28 17:15:15+00:00,2025-08-28

197d067ef9e67ba3,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The $5k hiring system (sell to clients),"Today I've got another banger Client Ready Workflow for you.

You'll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem the workflow solves
* How it's structured/how it works
* A template you can grab for free (and sell to your own clients)

Let's dive in.

I worked with a 7-figure coaching business that had a big issue:

They were drowning in hiring admin work and losing great
candidates because of slow follow-up.

So I built a complete Hiring Automation System for them.

The result?

Reduced hiring admin from ~15 hours to ~2 hours per week and
improved candidate experience dramatically.

Here's exactly how it works, why every growing business needs
this, and how you can grab the templates for free.

The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

Some wild stats:

* Stat 1: 70% of job seekers lose interest if they don't hear
back within one week of an interview (Addison Group)
* Stat 2: 57% of job seekers lose interest when the process drags
on (general study)
* Stat 3: 83% of candidates say a negative interview experience
can change their minds about a role or company they once liked""
(LinkedIn)

Which means:

* If you’re slow, you’ll lose applicants
* If you have a bad process, you’ll lose applicants
* If you lose the best applicants, your business will start
underperforming

You can see how this becomes a negative spiral.

What does this tell us?

That by automating your hiring process, you will close better
candidates faster.

How The System Works
--------------------

This isn't just another ""automated email"" system. This is an
intelligent 3-part hiring pipeline that manages the entire
candidate journey from application to final interview.

Here's the complete workflow:

Part 1: Application Intake Automation

* Monitors Typeform for new sales position applications
* Automatically creates ClickUp tasks with all candidate details
* Maps form data to custom fields (name, email, phone, experience
level)",2025-07-03T13:09:20+00:00,promotion,low,0,,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,2025-07-03 13:09:20+00:00,2025-07-03
197f4711d86cb025,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,Sell this to marketing agencies ($6k system),"Today’s Client Ready Workflow is a useful one.

You can sell it to any marketing agency and many other
businesses.

You'll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem the workflow solves
* How it's structured/how it works
* A template you can grab for free (and sell to your own clients)

Let's dive in.

I built an AI-Powered Lead Magnet Generator for a marketing
agency. Their issue? Creating custom lead magnets for clients
took 8-12 hours and cost them thousands in designer fees.

The result?

Reduced lead magnet creation time from 12 hours to 3 minutes
while improving quality and consistency.

It’s important to re-read the last part of that sentence:

“While improving quality and consistency”.

It’s not enough to make something faster, you need to make it
better.

Here's exactly how it works, why every agency and consultant
needs this, and how you can grab the template for free.

The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

A client runs a marketing agency.

Could be Facebook ads, email marketing, YouTube content, or cold
email. And they request a lead magnet…even though it’s not in
your wheelhouse. Because you always need more lead magnets.
You’re left with 2 options:

* Say no (and risk disappointing the client)
* Say yes (and spend 12 hours on an unpaid project)

Not a situation most business owners want to be in.

What if there was a third option?

What if you could deliver a professionally designed, fully
customized lead magnet in a few minutes? What if saying ""yes"" to
every content request actually became profitable instead of
painful?

That's exactly what this system does. You don’t have to choose
between client satisfaction and profitability.

How The System Works
--------------------

This isn't just another ""template generator."" This is an
intelligent AI system that creates fully customized,
professionally designed lead magnets from simple inputs.

Here's the complete 6-step workflow:
