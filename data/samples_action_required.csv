19938dfcc81410ce,gmail,"""Jerry Lee, Wonsulting"" <jerrylee@wonsulting.com>",8 interviews in 14 days (how we did it),"Hey Siddhartha,
=C2=A0
Jerry=E2=80=A6=C2=A0
I've been applying for four months and only got two interviews.=C2=A0
What am I doing wrong?

=C2=A0
That text came from my friend Tiff last month. Despite having Google and Ze=
ndesk on her resume, her job search had completely stalled.

Tiff and I met back in 2018 when our teams collaborated at Google, and we'v=
e stayed close ever since.

https://app.wonsulting.ai/community?resume=3Dc725a8b7-7676-4ee1-b796-9dc18b=
9fe410

Us at Google, 2018

=C2=A0
So when she told me she needed help getting interviews, I had to step in. N=
ot as ""Jerry the co-founder,"" but like our coaching team would for any clie=
nt.

We treated her search like a project.

Here's what we did differently:

=E2=9C=93 Define: We picked one target role she'd be excited about and comp=
etitive for.
=E2=9C=93 Package: We rebuilt her resume to the role's success criteria and=
 synced LinkedIn to match.
=E2=9C=93 Launch: We shipped a tight, 50-company application sprint with hi=
gh-fit companies only.

Two weeks later? She's gotten 8+ interviews (=E2=89=8816% interview rate).

=C2=A0
And she's now in final rounds at multiple companies.

When I think about it, Tiff=E2=80=99s biggest hurdle was mindset.=C2=A0

She had been undervaluing her seniority and market value. Our work surfaced=
 wins she had been downplaying and put them front and center.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I've been there myself.
=C2=A0
When I was job searching, I wish I had someone to help coach me.=C2=A0

I wish I had someone help me realize that I'd been underselling myself and =
targeting the wrong roles.

Sometimes you need that second pair of eyes to see your blind spots.

If your search feels stuck too, remember this framework:

=E2=9C=93 Define one specific role (and its success metrics)
=E2=9C=93 Package your achievements to mirror those metrics (resume + Linke=
dIn)
=E2=9C=93 Launch a short, intense, high-fit sprint

That's what we do at ",2025-09-11T13:03:34+00:00,work,high,1,Respond or prepare deliverables,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,2025-09-11 13:03:34+00:00,2025-09-11
19938b47f14c83e3,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The $5k hiring system (sell to clients),"Today we‚Äôve got another banger Client Ready Workflow for you.

My 7-figure Hiring System.

I like this one for 2 reasons:

* Companies who are hiring are making money. AKA they have money
and can pay for your service.
* Hiring is a hassle‚Ä¶finding the right people, interviews,
updates. AKA it‚Äôs a big problem we can help solve.

You‚Äôll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem the workflow solves
* How it‚Äôs structured/how it works
* A template you can grab for free (and sell to your own clients)

Let‚Äôs dive in.

I worked with a 7-figure coaching business that had a big issue:

They were drowning in hiring admin work and losing great
candidates because of slow follow-up.

Think of how many companies say ‚Äúwe‚Äôll get back to you in 3 days‚Äù
but don‚Äôt get back to candidates for 2 weeks.

I built a complete Hiring Automation System for them.

As a result, they reduced hiring admin from ~15 hours to ~2 hours
per week and improved candidate experience dramatically.

Here‚Äôs exactly how it works, why every growing business needs
this, and how you can grab the templates for free.

-----------------------
The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

Some wild stats:

* Stat 1: 70% of job seekers lose interest if they don‚Äôt hear
back within one week of an interview (Addison Group)
* Stat 2: 57% of job seekers lose interest when the process drags
on (general study)
* Stat 3: 83% of candidates say a negative interview experience
can change their minds about a role or company they once liked
(LinkedIn)

Which means:

* If you‚Äôre slow, you‚Äôll lose applicants
* If you have a bad process, you‚Äôll lose applicants
* If you lose the best applicants, your business will start
underperforming

You can see how this becomes a negative spiral.

What does this tell us?

That by automating your hiring process, you will close better
candidates faster.

Napkin AI Coloured Logo

Hi Siddhartha,

¬†

Today, we're excited to share a massive upgrade to one of your most-loved
visuals: Mindmaps. As our most generated visual type, many of you have been
asking for more flexibility. That‚Äôs why we've expanded beyond a single format to
give you multiple designs, each with various styles, orientations, and the
ability to edit them easily.

A video showing Napkin's new mindmaps
[https://img.mmdocdn.com/mailmodo/image/upload/ar_600:337,c_crop/v1757400829/editor/p/7648eefe-a944-4e2f-92a7-d39fc3042024/b4a10347fbb9144b1094b8f20e81d98e_o3l0t0.png]https://youtu.be/zhl7enbyohk

Here‚Äôs what's new:

¬†

 * More mindmap formats with extensive style options: Napkin now generates
   significantly more mindmap formats and associated styles that not only look
   great but can capture different levels of detail and complexity in your
   ideas, ensuring you can choose the perfect visual for your content.
   ¬†
 * Choose from multiple orientation options: New mindmaps support horizontal,
   vertical, and compact formats designed to fit seamlessly in documents,
   presentations, social posts, and reports, so your mindmaps work perfectly
   wherever you need them.
   ¬†
 * Simplified editing that maintains layouts: Traditional mindmaps break when
   you edit them due to their complex node structures. With our new mindmaps,
   you can add or modify content without breaking the visual structure -
   mindmaps automatically adjust spacing and organization as you edit.

¬†

These improvements make mindmap creation much faster and easier - so you spend
less time formatting and more time developing your ideas.

¬†

We'd love your feedback

The Harvard Interview Secrets=C2=A0
(That Most Job Seekers Never Learn)

95% of interview preparation advice is backwards.

Everyone tells you to research the company's history, mission, and values.
=C2=A0
But then you sit there regurgitating facts like a Wikipedia page=F0=9F=98=
=85
=C2=A0
Meanwhile, Harvard graduates who actually get hired are doing something ent=
irely different.

They're preparing for interviews the same way consultants prepare for clien=
t meetings.

Here's their approach=F0=9F=91=87

=E2=80=8A

[Shadow]

Five Steps to Interview Prep

#1: Research the people, not just the company

Harvard students don't just research companies. They research people. They =
use LinkedIn to find the actual humans who'll be in the room. What projects=
 are they working on? What challenges keep them up at night?

#2: Master the 70/30 STAR method

You've heard of STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result). But Harvard student=
s spend 70% of their time on=C2=A0Action, because that's where you prove yo=
ur value.

#3: Prepare 6 detailed stories

Not bullet points. Stories. Harvard students practice until they sound natu=
ral, not rehearsed. Stories about problem-solving, leadership, and bouncing=
 back from failure.

#4: Ask questions that prove you belong

Instead of ""What's the culture like?"" they ask questions like, ""Given your =
expansion into Southeast Asia, how is this role positioned to support that =
growth?""

One question demonstrates strategic thinking. The other proves you did zero=
 research.

#5: Steer the conversation

Harvard students treat interviews as strategic dialogue, not interrogation.=
 They ask follow-up questions. They build on the interviewer's answers. The=
y make it feel like a business meeting between equals.

But there's something even more powerful...

198ccbc237b4eaa6,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,Sold this photography system for $3k,"Today's Client Ready Workflow solves a problem that costs service
businesses thousands every month: client no-shows.

You'll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it's structured/how it works
* You can grab the template for free

Let's dive in.

I built a complete Client Management System for a photography
studio that was losing $3,000+ monthly to missed appointments and
poor follow-up.

The result?

Reduced no-shows by 85% and eliminated 12+ hours of weekly admin
work while creating a premium client experience.

Here's exactly how it works, why every service business needs
this, and how you can grab the templates for free.

-----------------------
The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

Here's what every service-based business deals with:

* No-shows are expensive: The average photography session is
worth $500-$1,500. One missed appointment can ruin your entire
day's revenue.
* Manual follow-up takes forever: Sending confirmation emails,
reminder texts, and managing client data eats up 10-15 hours per
week.
* Clients forget appointments: Without proper reminders, even
your best clients will occasionally forget their scheduled
sessions.

Some sobering stats:

* 68% of clients will reschedule if reminded 7 days in advance
(Acuity Scheduling)
* 43% of no-shows happen because clients simply forgot (Calendly)
* Service businesses lose an average of $12,000 annually to
missed appointments (AppointmentPlus)

What does this tell us?

By automating your client management process, you'll save money,
save time, and create a better experience that keeps clients
coming back.

--------------------
How The System Works
--------------------

This is an intelligent 3-part client journey that manages
everything from booking to follow-up.

Here's the complete workflow:

198c7bb9f86e9ef6,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The Upwork bidding mistake that's costing you clients,"I've made around $500,000 on Upwork using a bidding strategy that
most freelancers think is ""unprofessional.‚Äù

‚Äã
Here's what I'm going to show you:

How to get 6 qualified leads in one hour of work (instead of
spending all day crafting ""perfect"" proposals that get ignored).

The plan: I'll break down the exact psychology behind why lower
bids often win more work, the boost strategy that gets 90% of the
benefit for half the cost, and the conversation framework that
turns $1,000 posted budgets into $5,000+ projects.

During last week's community call, someone asked about Upwork
pricing strategy.

They were afraid to bid lower than what clients posted because
they thought it would make them look ""unprofessional"" or ""cheap.""

You do not need to bid exactly what the client posted (or higher)
to be competitive and win projects.

---------------------------------------------------------
Here's what actually happens when you overthink your bids
---------------------------------------------------------

You spend 20 minutes crafting the ""perfect"" proposal. You
research their company. You write custom copy. You bid their
exact amount or higher to ""show you're serious.""

Then... crickets.

Meanwhile, someone else who spent 3 minutes on their application
and bid slightly under gets the call.

Why? Because you're playing the wrong game entirely.

----------------------------------
The better Upwork pricing strategy
----------------------------------

If a client posts a $1,000 fixed-price job, I bid $915.

Not $1,000. Not $1,200 to ""demonstrate my premium value.""

$915.

But here's the key: I don't actually hold myself to that $915.

-------------------------------------------
Here's the psychology behind why this works
-------------------------------------------

Your only job with that initial bid is getting on a call with the
client. That's it.

Once you're on the call, everything changes:

198a981ef460430b,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The $300k focus system (how I 10x'd my productivity),"Today‚Äôs Client Ready Workflow is different.

Instead of breaking down a technical automation, I‚Äôm sharing the
personal system that took me from struggling entrepreneur to
$300k/month.

You'll get:

* The complete focus framework I use daily
* Why 99% of people think about focus wrong
* How to implement this system starting today
* The biological and cognitive ""hacks"" that actually work

-----------
The problem
-----------

For 9 years, I tried to build successful businesses. Some failed.
Some did okay. None were home runs.

I'd start projects with massive enthusiasm, get distracted after
a few weeks, jump to the next shiny object, and wonder why
nothing ever worked.

The answer is focus.

Take a look at some of these stats:

* The average knowledge worker checks email every 11 minutes
(RescueTime)
* It takes 23 minutes to fully refocus after an interruption (UC
Irvine study)
* People switch between apps 1,100+ times per day (RescueTime)

Not to mention the number of hours the average person spends
scrolling TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram every day.

------------------------------------------
What your life looks like if you can focus
------------------------------------------

Since mastering focus (and consistency), I‚Äôve gone from $0 to
$300k+/mo profit in 18 months.

And unlike most businesses, I‚Äôm the one doing everything. No
employees. Which means‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve got to be on my A Game.

I‚Äôm telling you: focus can literally change your life in a matter
of months.

So let‚Äôs talk about how to get focused.

------------------------------------------------
The 4-step method to building your focus muscles
------------------------------------------------

Focus is not a light switch.

You don‚Äôt turn it off and on. Instead, it‚Äôs a dimmer switch. You
can crank it up or crank it down.

Here‚Äôs the 4-part system:
