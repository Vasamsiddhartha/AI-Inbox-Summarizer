mail_199edfbabeff1446,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,Everyone is obsessed with YouTube,"Today’s Client Ready Workflow is one of my favorites because it
solves a problem every content creator has.

You’ll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it’s structured and works
* Free templates you can grab

Let’s dive in.

---------------------------------------------------
I built a YouTube Trend Detector — and it’s amazing
---------------------------------------------------

One of my friends and fellow YouTubers, Leonardo Gregorio, showed
me his approach to YouTube growth.

The guy went from zero subscribers to 20,000+ in just a few
months by doing one thing obsessively well: tracking what content
was going viral in his niche.

That’s where this idea came from.

Everyone who is getting started on YouTube as a creator or as a
business owner to drive leads to their business wants to do the
same.

They want to know what kind of videos are working in their space.

But it takes a lot of work. And most do it manually. Go in. Check
5-7 competitor channels daily. Document view counts and
subscriber counts in spreadsheets. Try to spot patterns.

It works.

But yikes. That’s a lot of time.

Instead, imagine this:

Every morning at 6am, you get an email showing exactly which
videos in your niche are performing 2-3x better than average.

As a result: You spot trends 24-48 hours before everyone else
catches on, creates similar content first, and captures the
majority of views.

Here’s exactly how it works, why every content creator needs
this, and how you can grab the templates for free.

The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

YouTube is absolutely exploding right now, and every business
owner is trying to make it work:

* Stat 1: YouTube has over 2.7 billion monthly active users and
continues growing 15% year-over-year (Statista)
* Stat 2: 90% of businesses say YouTube is critical to their
content strategy, but only 9% feel they’re doing it well (Wyzowl)
