199edfbabeff1446,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,Everyone is obsessed with YouTube,"Today’s Client Ready Workflow is one of my favorites because it
solves a problem every content creator has.

You’ll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it’s structured and works
* Free templates you can grab

Let’s dive in.

---------------------------------------------------
I built a YouTube Trend Detector — and it’s amazing
---------------------------------------------------

One of my friends and fellow YouTubers, Leonardo Gregorio, showed
me his approach to YouTube growth.

The guy went from zero subscribers to 20,000+ in just a few
months by doing one thing obsessively well: tracking what content
was going viral in his niche.

That’s where this idea came from.

Everyone who is getting started on YouTube as a creator or as a
business owner to drive leads to their business wants to do the
same.

They want to know what kind of videos are working in their space.

But it takes a lot of work. And most do it manually. Go in. Check
5-7 competitor channels daily. Document view counts and
subscriber counts in spreadsheets. Try to spot patterns.

It works.

But yikes. That’s a lot of time.

Instead, imagine this:

Every morning at 6am, you get an email showing exactly which
videos in your niche are performing 2-3x better than average.

As a result: You spot trends 24-48 hours before everyone else
catches on, creates similar content first, and captures the
majority of views.

Here’s exactly how it works, why every content creator needs
this, and how you can grab the templates for free.

-----------------------
The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

YouTube is absolutely exploding right now, and every business
owner is trying to make it work:

* Stat 1: YouTube has over 2.7 billion monthly active users and
continues growing 15% year-over-year (Statista)
* Stat 2: 90% of businesses say YouTube is critical to their
content strategy, but only 9% feel they’re doing it well (Wyzowl)

members asked questions that I think could change how you think
about your automation business.

These aren’t your typical “how do I find clients?” questions.

These are the questions people ask when they’re already making
money but want to scale smarter.

I’m sharing them with you today because these answers apply
whether you’re just starting or already doing $10k+/month.

Let’s dive in.

---------------------------------------------------------
Question 1: “My solution just became obsolete. What now?”
---------------------------------------------------------

The situation: John (name changed) spent 8 months building an AI
copilot for Klaviyo agencies. Then Klaviyo launched their own AI
agent that does basically the same thing.

Brutal.

My answer: Stop building massive orchestrated systems. Build lots
of tiny, hyperspecific solutions instead.

Technology moves so fast that if you spend 8 months perfecting
one big system, it’ll likely be obsolete before you finish.

The optimal play is to build 10 small solutions in that same
timeframe. Test all of them. Identify which one solves the
biggest constraint. Then spend your time selling that one, not
building.

Most people do the opposite—they spend months building, then
wonder why nobody buys.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2: “How do I sell backend systems like CRM automations?”
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The situation: Tim (name changed as well—they’re all changed for
anonymity) wanted to know how to position and sell CRM
automations through cold email, specifically to agencies and real
estate brokerages.

My answer: Offer a templated CRM setup completely for free (or
extraordinarily cheap).

Then charge for customization.

Here’s the email approach I used that got a 6% reply rate:

How To Get Hired When
1,700 People Apply in 15 Hours

The job market is flooded =F0=9F=8C=A7=EF=B8=8F=F0=9F=9A=A3

AI mass-application tools lowered the bar,=C2=A0so many applicants started =
applying to everything.

It=E2=80=99s just too easy.
=C2=A0
Candidates can fire off 100+ applications an hour.
But their generic applications don=E2=80=99t get noticed.

And they make it harder for truly good candidates to get seen.
=C2=A0
Last month, a Y Combinator startup posted 8 roles.=C2=A0
23,000 applications arrived in 30 days.=C2=B9

That's 2,875 people fighting for one position.=E2=80=8B

Spotify opened a single NYC engineering role.=C2=A0
1,700 applications in 15 hours.=E2=80=8B

You might think hiring managers
Would be excited about so many candidates.

But they're not. They're drowning.=E2=80=8B

Here's what nobody's telling you:=C2=A0
It's harder than ever for hiring managers to find qualified candidates

Recruiters at major tech companies report that only 10% of their hires now =
come from inbound applications.=C2=B9
=C2=A0
The majority come from direct outreach and referrals.=E2=80=8B

But here's the question that stops most people:
How do you find hiring managers?=C2=A0
And how do you reach them without seeming desperate?

This is where everything changes.=C2=A0

Because there's something that solves both problems at once =F0=9F=91=80

199e2162f511936a,gmail,Michael from Cursor <michael@mail.cursor.com>,"New in Cursor: Plan Mode, Slash Commands, and more","Hello,

It’s been a busy month with new features and quality-of-life improvements to Cursor!

*********
Plan Mode
*********

Plan Mode ( https://cursor.com/docs/agent/planning#plan-mode ) does deep research into your codebase, reading files and asking clarifying questions to create a detailed plan before writing any code. You can review and refine the plan before handing it to Cursor to execute.

We’ve found that this allows agents to run for significantly longer.

**************
Slash Commands
**************

You can now create reusable prompts and quickly share them with your team. Commands ( https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/commands ) are stored in .cursor/commands/[command].md. Run them by typing /  in the Agent input and selecting the command from the dropdown menu.

We’ve been using them for running linters, fixing compile errors, and creating PRs with detailed descriptions and conventional commits.

****************
Browser Controls
****************

Agent can control a web browser ( https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser ) to test applications, audit accessibility, convert designs into code, and more. With full access to console logs and network traffic, Agent can debug issues and automate comprehensive testing workflows.

Start using with @Browser.

************************
PR Summaries from Bugbot
************************

When creating a PR in GitHub, Bugbot ( https://cursor.com/bugbot ) will now generate a summary of the changes. The summary will be updated as you push changes so it's always up-to-date.

Let us know any feedback you have!

199ddaba5913ca3b,gmail,"""Jonathan @ Wonsulting"" <jonathan+j@wonsulting.com>",This is why referrals are beating your applications (+ Free Strategy Call),"Hey Siddhartha,

I know the H-1B lawsuit has been top of mind for many of you.

But here's the truth: We don't know what will change, and companies still need to hire.

The real problem? It's not the lawsuit.
 
It's that hiring managers are drowning in low-effort applications.
 
Think about it:

Other job seekers use AI tools to spam out hundreds of non-targeted resumes. Hiring teams can spot them instantly, but they can't stop the flood.

So they're doing what's reasonable: they're leaning toward referrals instead of job boards.

That's why the ""spray and pray"" method is dead.

If you want to stand out, you need a human strategy, not a copy-paste one.
 
That's exactly what we build with our clients:
 
✅ 90% of clients land offers within 120 days.
✅ The other 10% get a full refund + plus we keep coaching you until you're hired.
 
We take all the risk. You get all the results.
 
This week only, we opened 25 free strategy calls for email subscribers to identify what's holding you back, before the holiday hiring freeze hits.

 
👉 [Book your free strategy call →](https://form.typeform.com/to/KQqdWmNS)
 
Or call us now at (323) 425-4915.

 
 
Rooting for your success,

Jonathan Javier
Co-Founder & CEO, Wonsulting
