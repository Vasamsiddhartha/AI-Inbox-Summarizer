mail_199ddaba5913ca3b,gmail,"""Jonathan @ Wonsulting"" <jonathan+j@wonsulting.com>",This is why referrals are beating your applications (+ Free Strategy Call),"Hey Siddhartha,

I know the H-1B lawsuit has been top of mind for many of you.

But here's the truth: We don't know what will change, and companies still need to hire.

The real problem? It's not the lawsuit.
 
It's that hiring managers are drowning in low-effort applications.
 
Think about it:

Other job seekers use AI tools to spam out hundreds of non-targeted resumes. Hiring teams can spot them instantly, but they can't stop the flood.

So they're doing what's reasonable: they're leaning toward referrals instead of job boards.

That's why the ""spray and pray"" method is dead.

If you want to stand out, you need a human strategy, not a copy-paste one.
 
That's exactly what we build with our clients:
 
✅ 90% of clients land offers within 120 days.
✅ The other 10% get a full refund + plus we keep coaching you until you're hired.
 
We take all the risk. You get all the results.
 
This week only, we opened 25 free strategy calls for email subscribers to identify what's holding you back, before the holiday hiring freeze hits.

 
👉 [Book your free strategy call →](https://form.typeform.com/to/KQqdWmNS)
 
Or call us now at (323) 425-4915.

 
 
Rooting for your success,

Jonathan Javier

money but want to scale smarter.

The situation: John (name changed) spent 8 months building an AI
copilot for Klaviyo agencies. Then Klaviyo launched their own AI
agent that does basically the same thing.

Brutal.

My answer: Stop building massive orchestrated systems. Build lots
of tiny, hyperspecific solutions instead.

Technology moves so fast that if you spend 8 months perfecting
one big system, it’ll likely be obsolete before you finish.

The optimal play is to build 10 small solutions in that same
timeframe. Test all of them. Identify which one solves the
biggest constraint. Then spend your time selling that one, not
building.

Most people do the opposite—they spend months building, then
wonder why nobody buys.

Question 2: “How do I sell backend systems like CRM automations?”
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The situation: Tim (name changed as well—they’re all changed for
anonymity) wanted to know how to position and sell CRM
automations through cold email, specifically to agencies and real
estate brokerages.

My answer: Offer a templated CRM setup completely for free (or
extraordinarily cheap).

Then charge for customization.

This week we’re focusing on how to take your site from simple to stunning (and making sure you’re making the most of Bolt v2).

Is your site looking too “starter project”?

Laurel Beyers (designer + UX consultant) and Clark Wimberly (design engineer + agency owner) will answer your questions and explain a ton of practical ways to sharpen your site’s design:

- Smart planning and UX strategy that actually saves time
- How to use prompts to nail your aesthetic faster
- Adding fonts, icons, and polish that make clients go “woah”

Back in March, we earned SOC 2 Type I. Today, our Type II certification is official.

Type I proved our security controls were designed well. Type II proves our processes work consistently, over time, under real operational conditions.

Auditors examined our last 6 months of access logs, infrastructure changes, incident response, and every layer of our security posture, verifying we actually do what we say we do, every single day.
