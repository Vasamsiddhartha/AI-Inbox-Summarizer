Hi siddharthavasam,

As part of our dedication to community-driven evaluation, we're excited to  
introduce Kaggle Game Arena. Here, top AI models compete head-to-head in  
strategic games, starting with chess.

Game Arena is designed to benchmark model performance in dynamic,  
interactive environments. You'll see how models like Gemini, Claude, and  
others handle real-time decision-making, strategic planning, and  
adaptation, all running on Kaggle. Visit kaggle.com/game-arena and learn  
more on our blog.

First up is an AI chess exhibition tournament in partnership with  
Chess.com, Take Take Take, and top players including Hikaru Nakamura, Levy  
Rozman, and Magnus Carlsen. Matchups will stream live August 5–7 at 10:30  
AM PT each day on kaggle.com/game-arena.

Each game has its own open-source environment and harness, with results  
published as live leaderboards on Kaggle Benchmarks. On August 7, we'll  
reveal the Chess Text Input leaderboard, the inaugural installment of the  
broader Game Arena, which combines rigorous scientific methodology with  
spectator-friendly excitement. Over time, Game Arena will expand to include  
more games, modalities, and evaluation setups.

Curious what your favorite models are capable of? Dive into the bracket or  
catch the action live at kaggle.com/game-arena.

Happy Kaggling,

Hi siddharthavasam,

The OpenAI to Z Hackathon proved what happens when thousands of Kagglers  
tackle a challenge with creativity, collaboration and data.

In this hackathon, over 8,000 Kagglers became modern-day digital explorers,  
using open data and AI models to uncover secrets of the Amazon rainforest  
and bring ancient legends to life. Some teams focused on predicting hidden  
archaeological sites, others experimented with new patterns in the data and  
a few surprised us with entirely new approaches to discovery.

There were more than 200 submissions, each representing a unique way to  
explore a complex problem. Hackathons like this aren't just about accuracy  
- they're about imagination, experimentation and collaboration. They create  
a portfolio of creative solutions, showing what's possible when communities  
come together to explore a challenge from different angles.

The winning teams and projects have been announced, but the creativity and  
insights from all participants continue to inspire. You can explore all the  
writeups from the participants to see the wide range of ideas and  
approaches.





Explore Writeups



Your digital exploration continues! Kaggle will keep offering new  
hackathons to test ideas, collaborate and discover what's possible together.

Happy Kaggling!

1989f35ad926a7cc,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,"57 proposals, 4 deals, 1 breakthrough","So a Maker School member recently shared their stats with me:

* 57 proposals sent
* 13 replies
* 4 deals closed
* $500 total revenue

He saw this and thought he was failing. So did everyone else.
$500 from 57 applications?

That’s a lot of work. For a small payoff.

But today, I’m going to reframe this for you. Because he’s
actually CRUSHING it. And I’ll show you why he’ll succeed
long-term.

Getting paid to learn
---------------------

This member (anonymous for privacy) isn’t really making $500.

He’s making more like $5,000.

You just can’t see all the earnings. Because he’s getting paid to
learn. For example, these are some of the skills he’s picking up:

* Selling clients
* Scoping projects
* Managing expectations
* Building 4 different automations
* Getting case studies, testimonials, and building his Upwork
profile
* Closing clients who very well may buy more things from him in
the future

Six months from now, when he’s pitching $3,000 systems instead of
$125 ones, he’ll have hands-on experience with real clients, a
portfolio of completed projects, and the confidence that he can
deliver.

Small wins build momentum.

So start stacking them.

Clear input-to-output equation
------------------------------

While everyone else is obsessing over individual deal sizes, he
figured out something more important: his input-to-output
equation.

Input: 57 Upwork proposals

Output: 4 paying clients

That's a 7% close rate from total proposals. He found an equation
that worked. And more importantly, one he can crank on.

Think about it.

If 57 proposals = 4 deals, then:

* 114 proposals = 8 deals
* 171 proposals = 12 deals
* 228 proposals = 16 deals

Same effort per proposal. Same skill level. Just volume
multiplication.

But the truth is, he’s going to get better at applications.
Better at landing clients. Better at charging high prices. So
those 16 deals might be worth $1,000 a piece, or $3,000 a piec",2025-08-12T16:55:50+00:00,promotion,low,0,,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,,

198f1ad35ec77d68,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The $4k Instagram system (AI finds your next clients),"Today’s Client Ready Workflow is perfect for anyone doing
Instagram outreach.

You’ll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it’s structured/how it works
* A template you can grab for free (and sell to your own clients)

Let’s dive in.

I built an AI-Powered Instagram Lead Generation System for a
social media agency. Their issue is they were spending 15+ hours
per week manually finding prospects on Instagram and crafting
personalized messages.

Result after working with them:

Reduced prospecting time from 15 hours to 30 minutes per week
while improving message personalization and response rates.

Here’s exactly how it works, why every agency needs this, and how
you can grab the templates for free.

-----------------------
The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

Here’s what every business doing Instagram outreach deals with:

* Manual prospect research takes forever: Finding potential
clients by manually scrolling through competitor followers
* Generic messages get ignored: Copy-paste DMs have terrible
response rates because they’re obviously automated
* Scaling kills personalization: The more prospects you contact,
the less personal each message becomes
* Data management nightmare: Keeping track of who you’ve
contacted, their details, and follow-up status

I built this system for a social media agency that was spending
their entire Monday and Tuesday manually researching Instagram
prospects and crafting personalized messages.

Some wild stats about Instagram outreach:

* Stat 1: Personalized messages get 6x higher response rates than
generic templates (Hootsuite)
* Stat 2: 71% of businesses use Instagram for lead generation,
but only 23% have it automated (Sprout Social)
* Stat 3: Manual Instagram prospecting takes an average of 12
minutes per qualified lead (Social Media Examiner)

What does this tell us? By automating Instagram prospecting with
AI personalization, you can dramatica",2025-08-28T17:15:15+00:00,promotion,low,0,,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,,

197d067ef9e67ba3,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The $5k hiring system (sell to clients),"Today I've got another banger Client Ready Workflow for you.

You'll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem the workflow solves
* How it's structured/how it works
* A template you can grab for free (and sell to your own clients)

Let's dive in.

I worked with a 7-figure coaching business that had a big issue:

They were drowning in hiring admin work and losing great
candidates because of slow follow-up.

So I built a complete Hiring Automation System for them.

The result?

Reduced hiring admin from ~15 hours to ~2 hours per week and
improved candidate experience dramatically.

Here's exactly how it works, why every growing business needs
this, and how you can grab the templates for free.

The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

Some wild stats:

* Stat 1: 70% of job seekers lose interest if they don't hear
back within one week of an interview (Addison Group)
* Stat 2: 57% of job seekers lose interest when the process drags
on (general study)
* Stat 3: 83% of candidates say a negative interview experience
can change their minds about a role or company they once liked""
(LinkedIn)

Which means:

* If you’re slow, you’ll lose applicants
* If you have a bad process, you’ll lose applicants
* If you lose the best applicants, your business will start
underperforming

You can see how this becomes a negative spiral.

What does this tell us?

That by automating your hiring process, you will close better
candidates faster.

How The System Works
--------------------

This isn't just another ""automated email"" system. This is an
intelligent 3-part hiring pipeline that manages the entire
candidate journey from application to final interview.

Here's the complete workflow:

Part 1: Application Intake Automation

* Monitors Typeform for new sales position applications
* Automatically creates ClickUp tasks with all candidate details
* Maps form data to custom fields (name, email, phone, experience
level)",2025-07-03T13:09:20+00:00,promotion,low,0,,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,,
197f4711d86cb025,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,Sell this to marketing agencies ($6k system),"Today’s Client Ready Workflow is a useful one.

You can sell it to any marketing agency and many other
businesses.

You'll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem the workflow solves
* How it's structured/how it works
* A template you can grab for free (and sell to your own clients)

Let's dive in.

I built an AI-Powered Lead Magnet Generator for a marketing
agency. Their issue? Creating custom lead magnets for clients
took 8-12 hours and cost them thousands in designer fees.

The result?

Reduced lead magnet creation time from 12 hours to 3 minutes
while improving quality and consistency.

It’s important to re-read the last part of that sentence:

“While improving quality and consistency”.

It’s not enough to make something faster, you need to make it
better.

Here's exactly how it works, why every agency and consultant
needs this, and how you can grab the template for free.

The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

A client runs a marketing agency.

Could be Facebook ads, email marketing, YouTube content, or cold
email. And they request a lead magnet…even though it’s not in
your wheelhouse. Because you always need more lead magnets.
You’re left with 2 options:

* Say no (and risk disappointing the client)
* Say yes (and spend 12 hours on an unpaid project)

Not a situation most business owners want to be in.

What if there was a third option?

What if you could deliver a professionally designed, fully
customized lead magnet in a few minutes? What if saying ""yes"" to
every content request actually became profitable instead of
painful?

That's exactly what this system does. You don’t have to choose
between client satisfaction and profitability.

How The System Works
--------------------

This isn't just another ""template generator."" This is an
intelligent AI system that creates fully customized,
professionally designed lead magnets from simple inputs.

Here's the complete 6-step workflow:

19938dfcc81410ce,gmail,"""Jerry Lee, Wonsulting"" <jerrylee@wonsulting.com>",8 interviews in 14 days (how we did it),"Hey Siddhartha,
=C2=A0
Jerry=E2=80=A6=C2=A0
I've been applying for four months and only got two interviews.=C2=A0
What am I doing wrong?

=C2=A0
That text came from my friend Tiff last month. Despite having Google and Ze=
ndesk on her resume, her job search had completely stalled.

Tiff and I met back in 2018 when our teams collaborated at Google, and we'v=
e stayed close ever since.

https://app.wonsulting.ai/community?resume=3Dc725a8b7-7676-4ee1-b796-9dc18b=
9fe410

Us at Google, 2018

=C2=A0
So when she told me she needed help getting interviews, I had to step in. N=
ot as ""Jerry the co-founder,"" but like our coaching team would for any clie=
nt.

We treated her search like a project.

Here's what we did differently:

=E2=9C=93 Define: We picked one target role she'd be excited about and comp=
etitive for.
=E2=9C=93 Package: We rebuilt her resume to the role's success criteria and=
 synced LinkedIn to match.
=E2=9C=93 Launch: We shipped a tight, 50-company application sprint with hi=
gh-fit companies only.

Two weeks later? She's gotten 8+ interviews (=E2=89=8816% interview rate).

=C2=A0
And she's now in final rounds at multiple companies.

When I think about it, Tiff=E2=80=99s biggest hurdle was mindset.=C2=A0

She had been undervaluing her seniority and market value. Our work surfaced=
 wins she had been downplaying and put them front and center.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I've been there myself.
=C2=A0
When I was job searching, I wish I had someone to help coach me.=C2=A0

I wish I had someone help me realize that I'd been underselling myself and =
targeting the wrong roles.

Sometimes you need that second pair of eyes to see your blind spots.

If your search feels stuck too, remember this framework:

=E2=9C=93 Define one specific role (and its success metrics)
=E2=9C=93 Package your achievements to mirror those metrics (resume + Linke=
dIn)
=E2=9C=93 Launch a short, intense, high-fit sprint

That's what we do at ",2025-09-11T13:03:34+00:00,work,high,1,Respond or prepare deliverables,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,,
1980e30bdf51c4b9,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The automation myth that's keeping you stuck,"During last week's exclusive Maker School community call, someone
shared their cold email stats:

* 3,400 emails sent
* 2% reply rate
* Only 2 opportunities.

They were convinced they were failing.

But here's the myth that's keeping way too many people stuck:

""I need to send hundreds of applications and get high reply rates
to succeed.""

Let me show you how it really works (proof from student wins JUST
in the last 7 days in Maker School)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* Max landed his first Upwork call after only 17 proposals and a
$75 investment.
* Bree was 50 applications deep after 2 weeks and feeling like it
was ""impossible."" Then she landed a $1,500 contract.
* Zander got a job offer by his 3rd proposal on Day 3.
* Tony applied to ""like 40 jobs"" and got his first win.
* Chris won his first project on Day 8 with a small $97 job.

​
Notice the pattern? These aren't people sending 1,000
applications. Most succeeded with 17-50 applications.

But here's what really matters: the math behind why small numbers
work.

During our call, I walked through the reality of a 2% reply rate
campaign. Here's the breakdown:

* 2% reply rate × 33% positive replies = 0.66% positive rate
* That's 1 opportunity per 150 emails sent
* Send 1,000 emails? You get 6 opportunities
* Book half of those? 3 meetings
* 2 people show up? 2 sales calls

The math is simple: If you send 500 emails per day for 25 days,
you're booking 25 sales calls per month off a ""terrible"" 2% reply
rate.

Most people obsess over reply rates when they should focus on
positive reply rates and show-up rates.

You know what kills more automation agencies than low reply
rates?

Application paralysis.

People think they need to send 100 applications a day, so they
never start sending any. They think they need 10% reply rates, so
they never launch their first campaign.

Meanwhile, students like Adam close 4 contracts in 4 days",2025-07-15T13:05:28+00:00,transaction,high,1,Review booking / invoice / payment details,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,,
1987a4da459bcfb0,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The caveman approach to $10k/month,"Hey!

Nick here.

I was scrolling through our Maker School wins channel this
morning and had to do a double-take.

In just the last 48 hours, members have posted over $30,000 in
closed deals.

Some of these wins blew my mind, so I wanted to share them with
you.

* Felix landed his first client on Day 4 for $188 on Upwork
* Vasu closed his first $100 client using WhatsApp API knowledge
* Bolaji just closed his first client since joining the program
* Nisse closed a $4,000 deal for 60 hours building an AI
Executive assistant
* Benjamin closed a $5,000 deal (and he's building the website
with a colleague)
* Dimitris landed an $8,000 web app project and his advice? ""Be
Fast and Confident""
* Rahim signed a 6+ month contract worth $1,200/month plus
bonuses
* Aaron titled his post ""It Took Me 109 Days To Become An
Overnight Success""
* Mateo closed his second deal for $4,383 in Month 2
* Karim made $5,800 in 60 days with ""zero biz experience"" as a
full-time university student

Love to see it.

But despite all these wins, I still hear some of the same
concerns on every community calls.

So time to address them!

-------------------------------------------------------
Objection #1: ""This market is too saturated to succeed”
-------------------------------------------------------

Here's the harsh truth:

$10,000/mo is objectively a small sum of money.

I know it doesn't seem that way when you're at the starting line.
That's probably more than 95% of people in your network make. But
from a market perspective, it's tiny.

There is room in any market for anyone to make another $10,000 a
month. It doesn't matter how ""saturated"" it is. It doesn't matter
how competitive it seems.

-------------------------------------------------
Objection #2: ""I need to stand out to make money”
-------------------------------------------------

You don’t need to stand out.

You need to be consistent and demonstrate volume.

Hi siddharthavasam,

Unlock the hidden value in your data with BigQuery AI.

Companies are sitting on piles of data, including chat logs, PDFs,  
screenshots, and recordings, but they can't do much with it. It's often  
locked away in old systems, stuck in formats no one can touch, or just too  
messy to deal with.

In this hackathon, you'll build working prototypes that use BigQuery's  
Generative AI, Vector Search, and multimodal capabilities to solve data  
problems. Maybe you'll dig up related records from a giant archive, pull  
quick summaries from long reports, or piece together insights from text,  
images, and audio. And you'll do all of this while staying in SQL.

By combining these AI tools, you can unlock the hidden value in messy or  
unused data.

Hi siddharthavasam,

We're excited to introduce Kaggle Writeups, a new format for longer-form,  
shareable content on Kaggle.

Writeups give you a clean, focused space to publish Competition solutions,  
personal projects, or professional work. Unlike forum threads, Writeups are  
designed to highlight your work, offering a cleaner, more readable layout  
and making it easier to share your full project story.



Writeups are available in two formats: Solution Writeups, designed to  
better showcase Competition solutions, and Project Writeups, ideal for  
presenting your own data science work and projects in a clear, professional  
format, no matter where it's hosted.

Writeups also support multimedia galleries, rich link previews for tools  
like Hugging Face or GitHub, and the ability to annotate those links with  
extra context, making it easier to explain how everything fits together.

And of course, Hackathon submissions will continue to use the Writeups  
format, with all the same tools for fast-paced, collaborative work. You can  
browse past entries like those from the Meta Kaggle Hackathon to see what's  
possible.

Ready to publish your first Writeup? Learn more and get started.

Happy Kaggling!

Hi siddharthavasam,

Students are often asked to explain their mathematical reasoning. These  
explanations provide insights into student thinking, and often reveal  
underlying misconceptions.

Tagging students' explanations as 'containing potential misconceptions' is  
valuable for diagnostics, but it is time-consuming and challenging to scale.

In this competition, you'll build NLP models that predict potential math  
misconceptions in student explanations, enabling teachers to catch common  
errors faster.





Total Prizes:

$55,000


Entry Deadline:

October 8, 2025

Your work could help improve math instruction and make it easier for  
teachers to identify and address students' incorrect thinking.

Good luck,

from the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 to today.

You'll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it's structured and works
* Free template to implement it yourself

-----------------------
The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

Here's what every content marketer (especially at big companies)
is dealing with right now:

* Content demand is exploding: Clients want 20+ blog posts per
month, but quality writers charge $200+ per article
* Manual research takes forever: Finding trending topics,
analyzing competitors, and creating original content eats up
15-20 hours per week
* SEO windows close fast: By the time you research, write, and
publish, the trending topic has already peaked

I built this system for a marketing agency that was spending
$8,000/month on freelance writers and still couldn't keep up with
client demands.

--------------------------
The AI Parasite SEO System
--------------------------

This automation finds trending Medium articles, transforms them
into original content, and scales your output by 1000%.

Here's how it works:

Step 1: Automated Content Discovery

* Webhook triggers when new trending articles are found on Medium
(pre-validated content)
* Apify scraper extracts the full article content, author info,
and metadata
* System identifies high-performing content in your target niches

Step 2: AI Content Transformation

* GPT-4o converts the raw article into detailed bullet points
* Second AI pass transforms bullet points into completely
rewritten blog posts
* Title rewriter creates original headlines that maintain SEO
value
* Content maintains the core insights while being 100% unique

Step 3: Organization & Tracking

* Google Sheets automatically logs all source articles and
generated content
* Tracks original URLs, publish dates, and author information
* Creates Google Docs with formatted final co",2025-07-17T13:05:31+00:00,promotion,low,0,,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,,

Lovable Update —
Aug 2025
******************

Hey hey - we've got a lot of (pretty big) updates for you. Here’s everything we shipped to Lovable in past few weeks:

----------------------------------
Agent Mode is the new default mode
----------------------------------

image

With this upgrade, Lovable becomes a truly agentic partner—interpreting requests, understanding your codebase, fixing issues, executing complex multi-step edits across files, integrating with external tools, and reducing errors by 91%, so you can build more ambitious apps faster and with less friction.

Legacy mode (where you don’t use agent) will be sunsetting on September 1, 2025.

----------------------------------------
Real-time analytics on your Lovable apps
----------------------------------------

image

Curious how your app is performing in the wild?
You can now track live traffic and engagement directly inside Lovable including:

* Visitors: How many people are using your app
Pageviews: Which pages get the most attention
* Visit duration: How long users stay
* Bounce rate: What percentage leaves instantly
* Views per visit: How deeply users engage
The data updates in near real-time so you can spot trends, debug issues, or just celebrate your first users! Available now under Project Settings → Analytics

----------------------------------
Pricing change coming to chat mode
----------------------------------

Pricing for chat mode is moving from 1 credit per message to dynamic pricing, which matches the pricing model for agent mode. This means that each message and response cost is based on the complexity of the message; so some messages and responses cost less than 1 credit, and some, if quite complex, cost more. This change will be rolling out to all users on September 1, 2025.

Lovable Update —
September 2025
******************

Here’s everything we shipped to Lovable in the past couple weeks:

--------------------------------
Student + teacher discount live!
--------------------------------

imageWe’re making it easier for students and educators to get building. Now, both students and teachers can get 50% off Pro for up to a year. The discount applies if you’re starting from a free workspace—so you can unlock the full power of Lovable without stretching your budget.

-----------------------------
Lovable’s security upgrades
-----------------------------

imageSecurity is our priority. We’ve expanded our security features, policies, and certifications including adding SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and ISO 27001:2022 certifications. We also hired an incredible CISO, Igor Andriushchenko – so you can trust us with your ideas, your data, and your customers.
Read more about our security features here ( https://lovable.dev/security ).

Your new Lovable Inbox
----------------------

imageYour new personal inbox helps you track project and workspace invites, and you can also check out updates we’ve recently shipped—so you’re always up to speed.

------------------------
Smarter SEO for new apps
------------------------

When you create a new app or webpage, Lovable now includes agentic SEO instructions that better respect SEO best practices. This helps your projects get better indexed on search engines and reach the audiences you’re building for.

----------------------------
Workspace viewer role (Pro+)
----------------------------

For Pro+
members, we’ve introduced a new Viewer role. Viewers can see workspace metadata, projects, and members, but can’t create or edit projects or invite others. It’s the perfect role for stakeholders who need visibility, but don’t need to edit projects.

Hey builders,

The world’s best coding agents are coming to Bolt.

You’ve told us what’s been holding vibe coding (and tools like ours) back: endless error loops, half-wired backends, and prototypes that never reach production. We’re announcing the first step toward Bolt V2 today on X (https://d5llC804.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DQ+113/d5llC804/VX7J128Y4NHLW4ZnDg23Y0mT0W2L--MX5CfHP4N7Cq3xb3lcq-W7lCdLW6lZ3kxW8qPh3D4JS1V3W5rNw4K2lykhGW61pK4n1FmWVxW5X_7cr8BGSrXW1YmJkf4ZghVMW8Xc1-f5MyT2DW2H2xB27W9blWW3qrmWC788b0QW4WFBDK3HsCL0N8vTRlZPDT4ZW3rgXpD5lR8QQW2vFTfB5tg5_qW6mcJbm2B1GgXW4jw0zP5zz_MxV4hWpY6T67ygM1wxK_G3SnhW8LNh7z6rZTpqW8YHWKM3CHXCtW7KgV2V8VWsPYW28sZDY6pkslpW4PFp0g8KRYTgVpQmF47F-hrwN7DCCj0DhBzkW7b0zmW9jTQ1xf7m3hPW04 ) .

We’ve been listening. That’s why we’re bringing Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini CLI, the world’s best coding agents, into Bolt:

- No more error loops

- Build beyond prototypes

- Enterprise-ready products, right in your browser

And this is just the beginning. Claude Code is the first step toward Bolt V2, our biggest launch ever, coming later this month. Our community will be the first to test what’s next.

199372381ba46905,gmail,Napkin AI <contact@napkin.ai>,Introducing New Mindmaps in Napkin 🚀,"More formats, better orientations, and easier editing for your most-loved visual

Napkin AI Coloured Logo
[https://img.mmdocdn.com/mailmodo/image/upload/ar_568:103,c_crop/v1733926653/editor/p/7648eefe-a944-4e2f-92a7-d39fc3042024/872baa8974466b843efd0d5299424ff0_p3dnir.png]https://www.napkin.ai/

Hi Siddhartha,

 

Today, we're excited to share a massive upgrade to one of your most-loved
visuals: Mindmaps. As our most generated visual type, many of you have been
asking for more flexibility. That’s why we've expanded beyond a single format to
give you multiple designs, each with various styles, orientations, and the
ability to edit them easily.

A video showing Napkin's new mindmaps
[https://img.mmdocdn.com/mailmodo/image/upload/ar_600:337,c_crop/v1757400829/editor/p/7648eefe-a944-4e2f-92a7-d39fc3042024/b4a10347fbb9144b1094b8f20e81d98e_o3l0t0.png]https://youtu.be/zhl7enbyohk

Here’s what's new:

 

 * More mindmap formats with extensive style options: Napkin now generates
   significantly more mindmap formats and associated styles that not only look
   great but can capture different levels of detail and complexity in your
   ideas, ensuring you can choose the perfect visual for your content.
    
 * Choose from multiple orientation options: New mindmaps support horizontal,
   vertical, and compact formats designed to fit seamlessly in documents,
   presentations, social posts, and reports, so your mindmaps work perfectly
   wherever you need them.
    
 * Simplified editing that maintains layouts: Traditional mindmaps break when
   you edit them due to their complex node structures. With our new mindmaps,
   you can add or modify content without breaking the visual structure -
   mindmaps automatically adjust spacing and organization as you edit.

 

These improvements make mindmap creation much faster and easier - so you spend
less time formatting and more time developing your ideas.

 

We'd love your feedback

197ea3fe9aa54600,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,"""I can't afford expensive automation tools""","During last week's community call, a student asked a question
that hits close to home for a lot of people starting their
automation journey:

""What about expensive platforms like HubSpot and GoHighLevel? I
can't afford to play around with these tools, but clients keep
asking for them.""
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This objection comes up constantly. People think they need to
drop $500+/month on enterprise software subscriptions just to be
competitive.

Here's the reality: You're overthinking this.

Most platforms you'll encounter have free plans. HubSpot? Free
forever plan. ClickUp? Free tier. Zapier? Free tier. Even
""expensive"" platforms like GoHighLevel offer trials.

And guess what? If your free trial runs out you can always create
another email.

But here's where people get it wrong...

They think they need to become platform experts before they can
pitch clients.

You don't.

During the call, I told the student exactly what I'd do: Spend 30
minutes watching a tutorial and poking around the free version.

That's it.

30 minutes gets you enough knowledge to confidently say: ""Yeah, I
work with HubSpot. They separate contact details into three
levels - contacts, opportunities, and companies. I can definitely
build something that integrates with your existing setup.""

The math on this is insane:

* Time invested: 30 minutes
* Cost: $0
* Result: 2-3x more jobs you can confidently apply to

I've seen people skip applying to $5,000 HubSpot projects because
they ""don't know the platform."" Meanwhile, the person who gets
hired spent half an hour on YouTube.

Here's what actually matters to clients:
----------------------------------------

They don't care if you're a platform expert. They care if you can
solve their problem.

A client posting a HubSpot automation job isn't looking for a
HubSpot consultant. They're looking for someone who can connect
HubSpot to their other tools ",2025-07-08T13:35:44+00:00,promotion,low,0,,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,,

19915b0b7363a55a,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,Google Sheets to blog in 3 minutes (sell for $4k),"Today’s Client Ready Workflow addresses something every content
team is dealing with right now.

You’ll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it’s structured/how it works
* A template you can grab for free (and sell to your own clients)

Let’s dive in.

I built an AI-powered content publishing system for a digital
marketing agency that had a massive problem:

They were spending 15-20 hours per week manually formatting,
optimizing, and publishing content that was already written.

The result:

Reduced content publishing time from 45 minutes per article to
under 3 minutes while improving SEO consistency.

Here’s exactly how it works, why every content-heavy business
needs this, and how you can grab the template for free.

The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

Picture this scenario that’s playing out at thousands of
companies right now:

Your content team writes amazing articles. They’re stored in
Google Docs, planned in spreadsheets, but getting them live on
WordPress is a nightmare.

Each article requires:

* Manual HTML formatting (headings, lists, paragraphs)
* SEO excerpt creation
* WordPress slug optimization
* Publishing workflow management
* Quality control checks

Some brutal stats about content publishing inefficiency:

* 73% of content teams report that manual publishing workflows
are their biggest bottleneck (Content Marketing Institute)
* Average time per article: 45-60 minutes of formatting and
publishing work
* Error rate: 23% of manually published articles contain
formatting errors that hurt SEO

What does this tell us?

If you’re not using AI to automate content publishing, you’re
already behind.

While your competitors are manually copying and pasting content,
smart companies are using AI to publish content at 10x speed with
better consistency.

How The System Works

1990bebbd1077ae5,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,How two best friends hit $25k/month,"Hey!

Nick here.

Last month, I interviewed Jake and Kade on my YouTube channel -
two best friends from Australia who’ve been absolutely crushing
it.

​
What they told me:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
“Last month we hit 25K which was pretty insane for us initially
given that historically we’ve never been anywhere close to that.”
-----------------------------------------------------------------

They hit $25,000 last month.

You love to see it—especially when they’d joined Maker School
just 5 months ago coming off “rough months” of $2-3K revenue.

The lesson here isn’t that you need a business partner or
childhood friend to succeed at automation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
It’s that you don’t need to have everything figured out before
you start.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When Jake and Kade joined Maker School, they were stuck in
analysis paralysis. They’d been trying to make their gym niche
work for 2-3 years because they thought “if we pivot, we’re
failures.”

Some internet advice is good. But sometimes people take it too
seriously.

They were obsessing over having the perfect:

* Niche selection
* Ideal customer persona
* Mission and values
* Go-to-market strategy

Meanwhile, they were making $2,000 a month.

Here’s what actually happened when they stopped overthinking:

* Month 1 in Maker School: Hit $7,500 (their first big win)
* Month 2: Doubled it
* Month 5: $25,000 month

Their breakthrough came when they realized something crucial: Let
the market tell you what to do, don’t try to predict it.

Instead of forcing their gym niche to work, they pivoted to
“anyone who could benefit from cold email” and started applying
to everything on Upwork.

Their first win? A random $200 Make.com fix.

“We were super excited. We spent ages planning it out, jumped on
the call, and thought, ‘Okay this",2025-09-02T19:33:41+00:00,promotion,low,0,,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,,

 and what companies actually need.

You probably think you need more certifications,
more years in the field, more ""traditional"" experience.

role you want.

What do they know that you don't?

They know that your ""unrelated"" experience isn't unrelated at all=E2=80=94 =
It's differentiated.

And in a sea of identical candidates, different wins.

Angus learned this lesson.
=C2=A0
After months of applications going nowhere, one conversation with our team =
completely changed how he talked about his retail inventory experience.
=C2=A0
Suddenly, procurement teams saw him as the candidate with real-world supply=
 chain insights they couldn't get anywhere else.

That same reframe is waiting for you. Here's exactly how it works=F0=9F=91=

WONSULTING WISDOM

Your Secret Advantage =F0=9F=A4=AB

When Angus first came to us, he was doing what 95% of job seekers do.
=C2=A0
Click ""Apply."" Cross fingers. Repeat.
=C2=A0
He was an Inventory Manager in retail with an Economics degree, dreaming of=
 breaking into procurement.=C2=A0

On paper, he looked like every other career changer fighting an uphill batt=
le.

But that's exactly where his advantage was hiding.

You see, while traditional candidates often sound identical to recruiters (=
""I'm passionate about your company because...""), Angus had something they d=
idn't:=C2=A0

A completely different perspective shaped by real-world challenges.

The same retail experience he thought was holding him back?=C2=A0

Hi siddharthavasam,

Writing a program is one thing. Writing one that uses as few characters as  
possible adds a challenging hurdle to the task.

In this competition, you'll create Python programs that solve abstract  
reasoning tasks from the ARC-AGI benchmark. Each task provides a handful of  
input-output examples that illustrate a pattern, and your goal is to write  
a program that can generalize that pattern to new cases.

But there's a twist: your solutions must be not only correct, but also  
minimal. The shortest working code wins.





Total Prizes:

$100,000


Entry Deadline:

October 23, 2025

Your work could help establish concise reference solutions for this  
benchmark and advance research on more adaptable AI systems.

198324679557073c,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,How beginners charge high prices,"I was chatting with a Maker School student last week who’d built
a system for a client that caught my attention.

A semi-automated content generator.

It creates video ideas, captions, hashtags, images, and connects
to Pictory for final video creation.

Pretty sophisticated system. And it works—saves the client hours
each week. There’s a clear business impact.

But when I learned how much the student charged, I was a bit
surprised…

Only $350.

Which leads me to the topic of today’s email:

---------------------------------------------------------
“I don’t have enough experience to charge premium rates.”
---------------------------------------------------------

Does that resonate with you?

I know it does with a lot of students and beginners. Regardless
of the niche or business. But the mindset is flawed.

Think about it:

* If a realtor sells a house, they make 3% regardless of their
experience level.
* If a salesperson makes a sale, they get commission, regardless
of experience.
* If an Uber driver takes you to the airport, they get the same
rate, regardless of experience.

Don’t charge for experience.

Charge for value.

---------------------------------------
Content creation system value breakdown
---------------------------------------

Let’s run the numbers on what the $350 content system is worth to
the client:

Direct Cost Savings: Client currently pays someone $2,500/month
to create 10 videos.

The system reduces their workload by 70%, since the final videos
still need manual creation in Pictory.

Savings: $1,750/month

Opportunity Cost: With the automated ideation, captions, and
images, they can now produce 30 videos instead of 10. Each video
generates roughly $100 in revenue based on their metrics.

Additional revenue: $2,000/month (20 more videos × $100)

Total monthly value: $3,750

So this “inexperienced” person built a system worth $3,750/month
and charged $350 one-time.

1983d5c64eec28f6,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The $2k invoicing system (never chase payments),"Today's Client Ready Workflow is one of my favorites because it
solves a problem every service business has:

Getting paid on time.

You'll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it's structured/how it works
* You can grab the template for free

-------------------------------
Companies are drowning in admin
-------------------------------

I built this system for a marketing agency that was burning
around 8 hours per week with invoicing admin.

* Sending custom proposals and invoices.
* Chasing Net 30 and Net 60 Day invoices.
* Trying to collect on old clients who didn’t pay.

This is what their process looked like:

* Send proposal to client and wait for response
* Client says yes, manually create Stripe customer
* Manually build invoice with project details
* Manually send invoice via email
* Wait for payment before starting work
* Manually track payment status and follow up
* Only then mark opportunity as ""won"" and begin project

Result: 8 hours of admin work weekly, delayed invoices, and cash
flow problems.

After implementing this automation: 2 minutes of total invoicing
time per client.

------------------
Why companies care
------------------

The #1 reason companies go out of business is because of cash
flow issues.

Large, profitable companies go out of business EVERY day because
they don’t collect their cash fast enough and pay their creditors
too fast. They run out of cash. And even if they have good profit
margins, they can’t afford to keep team members, invest in

Lovable Update —
June 2025
******************

Hey,

In the last few weeks we've made some big changes and improvements you should know about!

Check it out:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent Mode (Beta): enabling Lovable to think, plan, and take actions autonomously
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

image

Over the
next couple days we're rolling out Lovable’s Agent Mode to beta, enabling Lovable to think, plan, and take actions autonomously.

Once the mode is available to you, you’ll be able to opt in through settings.

This mode reduces build error rates by 90%, cuts down on unwanted changes, and makes Lovable better at helping you reach your goals.

Lovable's Agent Mode can search your codebase, read files with full context, inspect logs and network activity, search the web in real time, and generate or edit images.

The price for the Agent Mode is usage-based and will depend on the complexity of the prompt.

Read more about the Agent Mode (Beta) and pricing here ( https://lovable.dev/blog/agent-mode-beta ).

Sign up for the livestream on Thursday where we'll go deeper into the Agent Mode here ( https://lu.ma/t3zd2j8r ).

-------------------------
Collaboration is now free
-------------------------

We've made collaboration on Lovable even more accessible by making it a free
feature for all users.

For Free and Pro users:

* Workspace collaboration is now completely free – invite your teammates and start building together at no additional cost.
* Unlocks workspace collaboration for up to 20 members on both Free and Pro plans.
* On Free plans, additional members join as editors; Pro plans offer granular workspace roles and permissions.

For Teams plan users:

1990a8489c5dd199,gmail,Wonsulting <hello@wonsulting.com>,💡These 5 questions decide your hire (You never see them),"[Shadow]

Your application answers
five questions you never see.

=C2=A0
Miss one, you're eliminated =F0=9F=91=80

Every hiring decision comes down to these unspoken questions.=C2=A0

But here's the problem: They're never asked directly.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
The Five Hidden Questions

While you're polishing your experience section, hiring managers are evaluat=
ing something bigger=F0=9F=91=87
=C2=A0

#1: Can you do the work?
Skills, experience, certifications. This is foundational, so let=E2=80=99s =
go deeper.

#2: Will you do it well?=C2=A0
One typo predicts careless project delivery. Inconsistent formatting sugges=
ts poor attention to detail. They're judging your future performance by you=
r current application quality.

#3: Do you actually want THIS job?
Generic cover letters scream ""mass application."" Did you research their rec=
ent product launch? Mention specific challenges they're facing? Or did you =
send the same letter to 47 companies?

#4: Can we actually hire you?
Work authorization, clean background, etc. Basic requirements you need to v=
erify yourself.

#5: Will you accept our offer?
Overqualified candidates get rejected constantly. Not because they can't do=
 the work, but because managers assume they'll leave for something better.
=C2=A0
So how do you get the answers right?

=C2=A0

[Shadow]

Why Question #3 Eliminates Otherwise Strong Candidates

Picture this scenario:

Two equally skilled applicants apply for the same role.
=C2=A0
Candidate A researched the company, referenced their values, mentioned thei=
r recent acquisition.
=C2=A0
Candidate B has slightly better experience, but their resume highlights the=
ir achievements in ""B2C mobile app growth,"" while this role is for a B2B en=
terprise software team.
=C2=A0
It=E2=80=99s a great resume=E2=80=A6 for a different job.

Who feels safer to the hiring manager?

Understand that they're not just hiring skills. They want someone who won't=",2025-09-02T13:01:21+00:00,promotion,low,0,,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,,
197c7b9f0d241245,gmail,Dev G <admin@gptlearninghub.ai>,2 Projects That Got Me $200K Offers,"Here’s a quick story from when I had no clue what I was doing… A while back, I was applying to AI/ML roles like my life depended on it… So naturally, I did what everyone else was doing… Watched YouTube tutorials… Built a basic project… And flexed my GPA on my resume… And guess what? Silence… No replies… No interviews… Just rejection emails with that cute little “We’ve reviewed your application” line… (Pain) But here’s the twist… Everything changed when I stopped trying to look “smart”… And started trying to look useful… I built just two projects… They solved real problems, and they were intentionally designed to stand out in interviews… Project #1: I re-implemented a famous AI research paper from scratch. (Nerdy? Yes. But it proved I wasn’t just a tutorial zombie…) Project #2: I fine-tuned an LLM for a specific business use-case. (Not just prompt engineering…actual value creation) These two projects got me offers at companies like Amazon, Google, and a bunch of AI startups… Eventually, I landed a $200K+ offer which was absolutely insane… I’m sharing this because if you’re a student trying to land an offer… You don’t need 20 projects… You just need the right two. And if you’re curious what made these projects so effective (and how you can build your own), I'll break it all down here… 👉 The Invisible Hiring Funnel No pressure… No fluff… Just the exact blueprint I wish I had back then… Hope it helps :) P.S.

19952a109211a992,gmail,Wonsulting <hello@wonsulting.com>,💡4 Tactics That Get You Hired (Not Your Resume),"[Shadow]

Are You Playing Your Job Search Right?

Hot take incoming =E2=98=84=EF=B8=8F

The hiring process isn't broken.=C2=A0
It's working exactly as designed.

It's just not designed for candidates =F0=9F=91=80

It's designed so hiring managers avoid making the wrong choice.

Think about it:=C2=A0

Why do you have to pass 5 interviews and a vibe check to be considered?
And why do companies take months to hire for ""urgent"" roles?

It=E2=80=99s because hiring managers don't get rewarded for hiring quickly.=
=C2=A0
They get punished for hiring wrong.

So they delay. They over-interview. They choose the ""safest"" candidate, not=
 necessarily the best one.
=C2=A0
This explains everything that frustrates you:

- Slow responses (they're checking with 5 other people)
- Weird interview processes (they're covering every possible risk)
- Ghosting after great interviews (someone got cold feet)
Now you have two choices here.
=C2=A0
You can keep expecting hiring to be logical, fair, and efficient
(sounds frustrating =F0=9F=98=85)
=C2=A0
Or you can accept the game and learn to play it strategically.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Here's how to play it strategically=F0=9F=91=87

=E2=80=8A

[Shadow]

Play the Game

The candidates who get hired aren't the most qualified.

They're the ones who understand hiring psychology.

Here are 4 tactics the best candidates use:
=C2=A0
=F0=9F=9A=A7 Become the safe choice=C2=A0
Show hiring managers how you reduce their risk. Craft a story that explains=
 why this move makes perfect sense right now. Hiring managers fear bad deci=
sions above most else. So eliminate their uncertainty with crystal-clear re=
asoning.
=C2=A0
=F0=9F=92=B0 Control the money conversation=C2=A0
Never discuss salary until there's an actual offer on the table. Use ""I'm c=
onfident we can work something out"" to deflect gracefully. Early salary tal=
k kills more opportunities than bad interviews do.

=F0=9F=98=AC Reframe your nerves",2025-09-16T13:05:08+00:00,promotion,low,0,,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,,

Hey there,

Most vibe coding tools are fun to start with, you can spin up a slick frontend in minutes, but they fall apart the moment you try to scale. They run on fragile infrastructure that’s prone to bugs, downtime, and data loss, and crumble under real world traffic.

Hours disappear into configuring integrations instead of building the product you envisioned. It’s the hidden tax every builder pays before going live.

Not anymore: Everything you need to launch websites and applications is available directly inside Bolt.

Today, we’re announcing Bolt Cloud, a way to build and scale websites and applications without leaving Bolt.

I have a strict hiring policy:

* **Developers?** Only Capricorns. They're analytical and precise.

* **Managers?** Definitely not Libras. Hired one, couldn’t make a decision.

* **Content team?** Strictly Cancers and Pisces. Sensitive, creative types.

Okay, obviously I'm kidding. That would be completely ridiculous.

Though funnily enough, you've probably already been hired (or rejected) because of something equally random as your star sign.

Something that, according to researchers, “isn't much better than astrology.”

You just need to swap out _Capricorn_ for _INTJ_ or _Libra_ for _ENTP._

And boom, suddenly you’re just practicing standard corporate hiring. 

I’m talking about personality tests—they are everywhere, and turns out, nearly 80% of Fortune 500 companies trust these tests to (not) choose new employees. 

(And if you're into astrology and I've just offended you... well, you know, us Sagittarius men simply “tend to be straightforward and honest, sometimes to the point of bluntness.”)

1995ce50a602bb13,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,Stop manually researching prospects ($4k automation),"Today’s Client Ready Workflow is perfect for any business doing
outbound sales or lead research.

You’ll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it’s structured/how it works
* You can grab the template for free

-----------------------
The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

I built this web scraping system for a marketing agency that was
burning 20+ hours per week on manual lead research.

Their process looked like this:

* Manually visit each prospect’s website
* Copy/paste information into spreadsheets
* Try to understand what each company does
* Write personalized email intros for each prospect
* Research competitors and industry details

Result: 20 hours of tedious work per week, inconsistent data
quality, and burned-out team members.

After implementing this automation:

Reduced research time from 20 hours to 30 minutes per week while
improving data quality and personalization.

Here’s exactly how it works, why every sales team needs this, and
how you can grab the templates for free.

-----------------------------
Why Companies Care About This
-----------------------------

Some relevant stats:

* 86% of buyers are willing to pay more for a great customer
experience (PwC)
* Personalized emails deliver 6x higher transaction rates than
generic emails (Experian)
* Sales teams spend only 33% of their time actually selling - the
rest is admin work (HubSpot)

What does this tell us?

That by automating research and personalizing outreach at scale,
you will close more deals faster while freeing up your team to
focus on actual selling.

--------------------
How The System Works
--------------------

This system handles website analysis and complex real estate data
extraction.

Here’s the complete workflow breakdown:

198a981ef460430b,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The $300k focus system (how I 10x'd my productivity),"Today’s Client Ready Workflow is different.

Instead of breaking down a technical automation, I’m sharing the
personal system that took me from struggling entrepreneur to
$300k/month.

You'll get:

* The complete focus framework I use daily
* Why 99% of people think about focus wrong
* How to implement this system starting today
* The biological and cognitive ""hacks"" that actually work

-----------
The problem
-----------

For 9 years, I tried to build successful businesses. Some failed.
Some did okay. None were home runs.

I'd start projects with massive enthusiasm, get distracted after
a few weeks, jump to the next shiny object, and wonder why
nothing ever worked.

The answer is focus.

Take a look at some of these stats:

* The average knowledge worker checks email every 11 minutes
(RescueTime)
* It takes 23 minutes to fully refocus after an interruption (UC
Irvine study)
* People switch between apps 1,100+ times per day (RescueTime)

Not to mention the number of hours the average person spends
scrolling TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram every day.

------------------------------------------
What your life looks like if you can focus
------------------------------------------

Since mastering focus (and consistency), I’ve gone from $0 to
$300k+/mo profit in 18 months.

And unlike most businesses, I’m the one doing everything. No
employees. Which means… I’ve got to be on my A Game.

I’m telling you: focus can literally change your life in a matter
of months.

So let’s talk about how to get focused.

------------------------------------------------
The 4-step method to building your focus muscles
------------------------------------------------

Focus is not a light switch.

You don’t turn it off and on. Instead, it’s a dimmer switch. You
can crank it up or crank it down.

Here’s the 4-part system:

past trends no longer apply.

In this competition, you'll develop an ML model to predict commodity prices

challenge is creating a model that stays accurate even as conditions change.

1992e93677995e7f,gmail,Wonsulting <hello@wonsulting.com>,💡The Harvard Interview Secret (95% Get Wrong),"[Shadow]

The Harvard Interview Secrets=C2=A0
(That Most Job Seekers Never Learn)

95% of interview preparation advice is backwards.

Everyone tells you to research the company's history, mission, and values.
=C2=A0
But then you sit there regurgitating facts like a Wikipedia page=F0=9F=98=
=85
=C2=A0
Meanwhile, Harvard graduates who actually get hired are doing something ent=
irely different.

They're preparing for interviews the same way consultants prepare for clien=
t meetings.

Here's their approach=F0=9F=91=87

=E2=80=8A

[Shadow]

Five Steps to Interview Prep

#1: Research the people, not just the company

Harvard students don't just research companies. They research people. They =
use LinkedIn to find the actual humans who'll be in the room. What projects=
 are they working on? What challenges keep them up at night?

#2: Master the 70/30 STAR method

You've heard of STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result). But Harvard student=
s spend 70% of their time on=C2=A0Action, because that's where you prove yo=
ur value.

#3: Prepare 6 detailed stories

Not bullet points. Stories. Harvard students practice until they sound natu=
ral, not rehearsed. Stories about problem-solving, leadership, and bouncing=
 back from failure.

#4: Ask questions that prove you belong

Instead of ""What's the culture like?"" they ask questions like, ""Given your =
expansion into Southeast Asia, how is this role positioned to support that =
growth?""

One question demonstrates strategic thinking. The other proves you did zero=
 research.

#5: Steer the conversation

Harvard students treat interviews as strategic dialogue, not interrogation.=
 They ask follow-up questions. They build on the interviewer's answers. The=
y make it feel like a business meeting between equals.

But there's something even more powerful...
=C2=A0

The Truth About Hiring Decisions

Companies don't hire the most qualified person.

Become the AI-Ready Hire They Need Now

We've got good news this July =F0=9F=91=80
=C2=A0
While only 40% of companies are hiring overall, 51% of tech companies are a=
ctively recruiting right now.=C2=B9
=C2=A0
But here's what most people don't know...

Companies investing in AI report the strongest hiring plans this quarter.=
=C2=B2
=C2=A0
Which means if you can position yourself as AI-ready, you're not competing =
for jobs anymore.

You're becoming the candidate recruiters hunt for.
=C2=A0
Here's how to get there:

=C2=A0
This week's AI-ready toolkit
=F0=9F=98=8E Resume transformation that screams ""AI-savvy"" (even if you're =
a beginner)
=F0=9F=91=80 3 AI upskilling moves that take 30 minutes to start

But first, let us show you something that might surprise you...

WONSULTING WISDOM

How to Add AI Skills to Your Resume

You're underselling yourself.

Most job seekers think AI skills require a computer science degree.
=C2=A0
But if you've ever uploaded a spreadsheet to ChatGPT for analysis, you've j=
ust demonstrated practical AI application that 90% of managers can't do.

The problem isn't your skills. It's how you're describing them.

Here's the formula that gets interviews:

Step 1: Lead with the Human Spark
""Engineered custom ChatGPT prompts..."" or ""Built AI-powered workflow...""
Start with action, not acronyms.

Step 2: Name the Technique (Briefly)
This depends on your level:

- Beginner: ""...using AI document analysis...""
- Intermediate: ""...leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation...""
- Advanced: ""...implementing custom vector search...""

Step 3: Drop the Business Impact
""...reducing report generation from 2 hours to 6 minutes.""

Always end with numbers that make CFOs smile!

Here's What This Looks Like:
=C2=A0
Starter: ""Automated competitive analysis using ChatGPT document uploads, re=
ducing research time from 4 hours to 30 minutes per client brief.""

configuration headaches







AUGUST 2025



Numerically Speaking



Welcome to the Anaconda Newsletter, your go-to for cutting through

the noise in AI and data science.






Welcome to the very first edition of Numerically Speaking. This is your 
monthly dose of Python, data science, and AI insights straight from the source. 
Think of it as your front-row seat to the innovations, tools, and trends 
shaping the future of open-source technology.



This month, Python’s influence in AI hit a new milestone, and we’ve released 
tools to help you skip setup headaches and get straight to coding. Here’s 
what’s new:


 



Python Continues Its Dominance in the AI Era 


Great news for the Python community! Python has achieved its highest-ever 
rating 
<https://www.infoworld.com/article/4033860/python-popularity-boosted-by-ai-coding-assistants-tiobe.html>
 in the TIOBE programming language popularity index at 26.98%.



According to TIOBE CEO Paul Jansen, AI coding assistants are helping fuel 
Python's continued growth. As he noted, ""We thought Python couldn't grow any 
further, but AI code assistants let Python take yet another step forward."" The 
availability of extensive Python resources for training AI models creates a 
positive feedback loop—making Python even more valuable for both learning and 
professional development.



Key takeaways:

 * AI coding assistants make Python more accessible to new programmers
 * Extensive documentation and libraries continue to drive adoption
 * Python remains the language of choice for data science and AI development

Hi siddharthavasam,

Intracranial aneurysms are bulges in the brain's arteries that often go  
unnoticed—until they rupture. That moment can be life-threatening, and it  
happens far too often. In this RSNA challenge, hosted with ASNR, SNIS, and  
ESNR you'll build ML models to detect and localize aneurysms across CTA,  
MRA, and MRI scans.

You'll work with expert-labeled data spanning 13 brain vessels, curated  
from 18 sites around the world. With variation in scanners, protocols, and  
anatomy, this competition will be a real-world test of your model's ability  
to generalize.





Total Prizes:

$50,000


Entry Deadline:

October 7, 2025

198c7bb9f86e9ef6,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The Upwork bidding mistake that's costing you clients,"I've made around $500,000 on Upwork using a bidding strategy that
most freelancers think is ""unprofessional.”

​
Here's what I'm going to show you:

How to get 6 qualified leads in one hour of work (instead of
spending all day crafting ""perfect"" proposals that get ignored).

The plan: I'll break down the exact psychology behind why lower
bids often win more work, the boost strategy that gets 90% of the
benefit for half the cost, and the conversation framework that
turns $1,000 posted budgets into $5,000+ projects.

During last week's community call, someone asked about Upwork
pricing strategy.

They were afraid to bid lower than what clients posted because
they thought it would make them look ""unprofessional"" or ""cheap.""

You do not need to bid exactly what the client posted (or higher)
to be competitive and win projects.

---------------------------------------------------------
Here's what actually happens when you overthink your bids
---------------------------------------------------------

You spend 20 minutes crafting the ""perfect"" proposal. You
research their company. You write custom copy. You bid their
exact amount or higher to ""show you're serious.""

Then... crickets.

Meanwhile, someone else who spent 3 minutes on their application
and bid slightly under gets the call.

Why? Because you're playing the wrong game entirely.

----------------------------------
The better Upwork pricing strategy
----------------------------------

If a client posts a $1,000 fixed-price job, I bid $915.

Not $1,000. Not $1,200 to ""demonstrate my premium value.""

$915.

But here's the key: I don't actually hold myself to that $915.

-------------------------------------------
Here's the psychology behind why this works
-------------------------------------------

Your only job with that initial bid is getting on a call with the
client. That's it.

Once you're on the call, everything changes:

198ec748818bde32,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,50-person agency thinks Upwork is unreliable,"A Maker School member runs a 50-person agency making revenue via
Upwork, and he said:

“I want to scale, but Upwork is unreliable for long term. How
would you suggest I scale my agency - my own product, e-commerce,
or what?”
-----------------------------------------------------------------

First off—props to him for running an agency that large.

I’ve never had that many people working for me.

But I disagree with the premise of his question. That Upwork is
unreliable. And I’m going to show you why.

(And just for context, I’ve made around $500,000 in profit from
Upwork (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/zlu4re72kwfnhk35z82iphw3gxg00t6hlmndd/3ohphkh3q4xo8vhr/aHR0cHM6Ly9nYW1tYS5hcHAvZG9jcy9Ib3ctSS1NYWRlLTUwMDAwMC1VU0Qtb24tVXB3b3JrLWdueWc4MWFleDV2M2Z3ZD9tb2RlPWRvYw==
) so I’m not just shooting from the hip.)

The plan: I’ll break down the real reason agencies plateau (it’s
not the platform), the unit economics that matter more than your
opinions about lead sources, and how to properly diversify
without abandoning what’s already working.

The problem with losing faith in lead gen channels
--------------------------------------------------

You convince yourself that the platform is the problem, so you
abandon a working lead source to chase some shiny new business
model.

Or some shiny new marketing channel.

And you stop doing the inputs required to get the level of
success you’ve already got.

Just look at the math behind lead generation
--------------------------------------------

Every lead source comes down to two numbers:

* CPA (Cost Per Acquisition): How much it costs you to get a
client
* LTV (Lifetime Value): How much that client pays you over time

That’s it. Nothing else matters.

Let me give you some examples:

* Upwork: CPA = $100, LTV = $2,000
* Cold email: CPA = $400, LTV = $4,000
* LinkedIn DMs: CPA = $300, LTV = $3,000

Hello, 

Welcome to Manus. 

Most AI tools are like that colleague who's great at brainstorming but never 
follows through. They can chat, they can suggest, but when it comes to get work 
done? You're on your own.

Manus is different. Think of it as an AI tool that finally executes your ideas 
and delivers concrete results.

  


  



How Manus delivers


Manus has its own computer where it operates various tools - programming, data 
analysis, design software, and more - to deliverables ready to be used. Whether 
it's creating files, building websites, generating images and videos, or 
developing applications, Manus uses its toolkit to turn ideas into reality.

  



Your reliable colleague that work synchronously with you


Start a stock analysis before your flight departure and receive the complete 
report when you touch down. Conduct research before a meeting and get 
comprehensive findings with recent news and competitive analysis while you are 
on other priorities. Manus can keep working while your devices are offline.

  



Simple instructions, comprehensive results


Describe what you need in simple terms. No complex prompts needed. Manus 
handles the execution from conducting research to delivering final output. You 
can adjust prompts or add new requests anytime by asking Manus to stop 
executing as your task evolves.



Your Manus workspace is ready.

Describe what you need and start!

1988575849f12d13,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,15 hours → 3 minutes (content repurposing system),"Today's Client Ready Workflow is one I use myself every single
day.

You'll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it's structured/how it works
* You can grab the template for free

​

-----------------------
The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

I built this system for a content creator who was spending 15+
hours per week manually repurposing YouTube videos into blog
content.

Here's what their process looked like:

* Watch entire YouTube video while taking notes
* Manually transcribe key points and quotes
* Research additional context and examples
* Write blog post from scratch using video as inspiration
* Format, edit, and publish to their website

Result: 3-4 hours per blog post, inconsistent publishing
schedule, and content that often missed key insights from the
original video.

After implementing this automation: YouTube video to published
blog post in under 3 minutes.

------------------------------
Why Content Creators Need This
------------------------------

Some wild stats about content repurposing:

* Stat 1: 73% of marketers say repurposing content is their most
effective strategy (HubSpot)
* Stat 2: Companies that repurpose content see 30% more web
traffic than those that don't (CoSchedule)
* Stat 3: 60% of content creators struggle to consistently
produce enough content (Content Marketing Institute)

What does this tell us?

Repurposing works. But it’s time consuming.

Most creators know they should turn their videos into blog posts,
social media content, newsletters, etc. But the manual work is so
time-intensive (and tedious) that they skip it entirely.

--------------------
How The System Works
--------------------

This isn't just another ""transcript to text"" converter. This is
an intelligent content transformation system that creates
publication-ready blog posts with proper formatting, structure,
and tone.

19938b47f14c83e3,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The $5k hiring system (sell to clients),"Today we’ve got another banger Client Ready Workflow for you.

My 7-figure Hiring System.

I like this one for 2 reasons:

* Companies who are hiring are making money. AKA they have money
and can pay for your service.
* Hiring is a hassle…finding the right people, interviews,
updates. AKA it’s a big problem we can help solve.

You’ll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem the workflow solves
* How it’s structured/how it works
* A template you can grab for free (and sell to your own clients)

Let’s dive in.

I worked with a 7-figure coaching business that had a big issue:

They were drowning in hiring admin work and losing great
candidates because of slow follow-up.

Think of how many companies say “we’ll get back to you in 3 days”
but don’t get back to candidates for 2 weeks.

I built a complete Hiring Automation System for them.

As a result, they reduced hiring admin from ~15 hours to ~2 hours
per week and improved candidate experience dramatically.

Here’s exactly how it works, why every growing business needs
this, and how you can grab the templates for free.

-----------------------
The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

Some wild stats:

* Stat 1: 70% of job seekers lose interest if they don’t hear
back within one week of an interview (Addison Group)
* Stat 2: 57% of job seekers lose interest when the process drags
on (general study)
* Stat 3: 83% of candidates say a negative interview experience
can change their minds about a role or company they once liked
(LinkedIn)

Which means:

* If you’re slow, you’ll lose applicants
* If you have a bad process, you’ll lose applicants
* If you lose the best applicants, your business will start
underperforming

You can see how this becomes a negative spiral.

What does this tell us?

That by automating your hiring process, you will close better
candidates faster.

--------------------
How The System Works
--------------------

1989e62ea9c614ba,gmail,Wonsulting <hello@wonsulting.com>,💡Want recruiters messaging YOU in September?,"[Shadow]

Want recruiters messaging YOU in September?

It's already starting.

=C2=A0
While most candidates wait until the fall rush to update their LinkedIn pro=
files, the smart ones start now.

=C2=A0
That way, by the time September hits, recruiters are already reaching out. =
Not the other way around.

=C2=A0
And here's the good news: You don't need months of work to stand out.

=C2=A0
With a few strategic changes, you can put yourself in the top 10% of profil=
es recruiters actually want to message.

=C2=A0

[Shadow]

The 4-Part Fast-Track to Getting Noticed

=C2=A0
1. Headlines That Pull People In =F0=9F=A7=B2
Generic headlines like ""Marketing Manager"" get lost in the shuffle. Instead=
, spotlight your results and specialty.

Instead of: Marketing Manager at ABC Company

Try: Growth Marketing Manager | Increased SaaS Revenue 40% | Demand Gen Spe=
cialist

Why this works: Recruiters scan for results, not job titles.
=C2=A0

2. Skills That Sell =F0=9F=92=B8
In 2025, degrees are becoming less important than demonstrable skills. This=
 means your Skills section is now prime real estate.

So make sure to:

- Find 5 job descriptions for your target role
- Pull the skills that appear most often
- Add them to your profile so AI screening tools instantly recognize you as=
 a match

3. Experience That Proves You Deliver =F0=9F=9A=9A
Swap vague responsibilities for specific, measurable wins.

Instead of: Managed marketing campaigns

Try: Launched 12 email campaigns generating $20K in revenue with 31% higher=
 open rates

Notice the difference? One shows responsibility, the other shows results.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
4. Signal You're Open for Business =F0=9F=91=8B
Turn on ""Open to Work"" (visible to recruiters only) and connect with people=
 at companies you're targeting.

Pro tip: Most people forget this step, then wonder why opportunities don't =
come to them.

The 3x Multiplier Changing Everything

=C2=A0
By now you know.
=C2=A0
The career landscape didn't just flip.
=C2=A0
It's been doing 360 somersaults for months =F0=9F=98=85
=C2=A0
And while job boards scream doom-and-gloom, here's what the headlines miss:
=C2=A0
In 2025, AI-forward companies are generating 3x more revenue per employee t=
han their competitors.=C2=B9
=C2=A0
And they're not just cutting costs.
They're paying=C2=A0premium salaries=C2=A0for people who get it.

Which means this isn't about surviving.
=C2=A0
It's about positioning yourself as the one they can't afford to replace...
=C2=A0

[Shadow]

The 3x Revenue Reality

When a company triples revenue per employee, they don't need more people.
=C2=A0
They need the right people.

Deloitte's data shows these top-AI companies are achieving up to 50% produc=
tivity gains.=C2=B2 And they're maintaining lean teams while generating exp=
onential value.

This creates an interesting dynamic.

These companies can afford to pay significantly more for each position.
One financial analyst who can orchestrate AI effectively replaces what used=
 to require an entire team.

That analyst becomes incredibly valuable.

We're seeing salary premiums of 40% or higher for professionals who demonst=
rate AI orchestration capabilities.=C2=B3

But here's what separates the winners from everyone else...

The Orchestration Advantage
Companies aren't looking for more AI users.

They're competing for AI orchestrators.

=F0=9F=98=84 Basic users achieve 2x productivity=E2=81=B4
=F0=9F=A4=91 Skilled orchestrators deliver up to 10x productivity=E2=81=B5
Strategic multipliers create entirely new revenue streams
=C2=A0
The difference? Orchestrators don't just use AI tools.
They coordinate multiple AI agents, optimize workflows, and identify opport=
unities others miss.

In healthcare technology? These roles are experiencing double-digit growth.

198564062e1a8db1,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The 7 step conversion killer,"I recently got asked about 1-call closes vs 2-call closes.

Which is better?

Both work. But the principle most agency owners would benefit
from following is “simple scales”. Because I see people who
believe this myth too often:

""More steps in my funnel will capture more leads and convert
better.""

It’s just not true.

Let me explain.

----------------------------
The 7-step conversion killer
----------------------------

Here's what most people's ""strategic"" funnel looks like:

Step 1: Send cold email asking ""Are you interested?""

Step 2: Prospect replies ""Yes""

Step 3: Send Loom video with value

Step 4: Wait for them to watch the Loom

Step 5: Hope they respond positively to the video

Step 6: Send calendar link

Step 7: Finally get them to book

It does sound logical. Start broad. Gauge interest. Deliver some
value. Ask for the meeting.

But here’s what happens:

You start with 100 people. 2% reply “yes” to your initial email
(not bad!). But then reality hits:

* Of the 2% who said yes, maybe half actually watch your Loom
(now down to 1%)
* Of those who watch, maybe half respond positively (now 0.5%)
* Of those who respond, maybe half actually book your calendar
(now 0.25%)

You just took a 2% response rate and turned it into 0.25%
bookings.

Every single step in your funnel is a leakage point. Every click,
every decision, every ""next step"" gives people another chance to
disappear.

-----------------------------
The 2-step conversion machine
-----------------------------

Here's what high-converting funnels actually look like:

Step 1: Send cold email with your full value proposition, how you
solve their problem, your offer, social proof, and clear next
steps

Step 2: They book a call

That's it.

""But Nick, won't fewer people say yes immediately?""

Yes. Maybe only 0.5%-1% will book directly instead of 2% saying
they're ""interested.""

But here’s the thing:

You’re working less. You’re ",2025-07-29T12:55:15+00:00,transaction,high,1,Review booking / invoice / payment details,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,,
198ccbc237b4eaa6,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,Sold this photography system for $3k,"Today's Client Ready Workflow solves a problem that costs service
businesses thousands every month: client no-shows.

You'll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it's structured/how it works
* You can grab the template for free

Let's dive in.

I built a complete Client Management System for a photography
studio that was losing $3,000+ monthly to missed appointments and
poor follow-up.

The result?

Reduced no-shows by 85% and eliminated 12+ hours of weekly admin
work while creating a premium client experience.

Here's exactly how it works, why every service business needs
this, and how you can grab the templates for free.

-----------------------
The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

Here's what every service-based business deals with:

* No-shows are expensive: The average photography session is
worth $500-$1,500. One missed appointment can ruin your entire
day's revenue.
* Manual follow-up takes forever: Sending confirmation emails,
reminder texts, and managing client data eats up 10-15 hours per
week.
* Clients forget appointments: Without proper reminders, even
your best clients will occasionally forget their scheduled
sessions.

Some sobering stats:

* 68% of clients will reschedule if reminded 7 days in advance
(Acuity Scheduling)
* 43% of no-shows happen because clients simply forgot (Calendly)
* Service businesses lose an average of $12,000 annually to
missed appointments (AppointmentPlus)

What does this tell us?

By automating your client management process, you'll save money,
save time, and create a better experience that keeps clients
coming back.

--------------------
How The System Works
--------------------

This is an intelligent 3-part client journey that manages
everything from booking to follow-up.

Here's the complete workflow:

Part 1: Instant Client Organization

* New booking comes in from website (WordPress, Squarespace,
etc.)

197c6190ea2118bc,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,The pricing myth keeping you broke,"Last week during our exclusive Maker School community call,
someone asked about landing higher-paying clients.

They were afraid if they did they’d sell fewer clients.

This is the myth that's keeping way too many people stuck in
$50/hour hell:

""If I raise my prices, fewer clients will hire me.""
---------------------------------------------------

First, let me acknowledge $50/hour is a great starting point. But
if you want to make $10k-$20k+/month you’ll need to change how
you price and how you think about it.

Let me explain why that myth is backwards thinking. During the
call, I walked through exactly what happens when you're trapped
in this mindset. You end up in what I call ""scarcity prison"" -
where you have 3 terrible opportunities and you're forced to pick
the least terrible one.

Maybe it's a $1,000 project that'll take 50 hours. Or a $2,000
project that'll take 90 hours. You do the math, pick the ""best""
hourly rate, and wonder why you're still broke.

But here's what actually happens when you raise prices:

Sometimes your conversion rate goes DOWN. Sometimes it goes UP.

Wait, what?

I've seen this dozens of times. Someone charging $2,000 for a
project gets ignored. They bump it to $3,000 and suddenly clients
are interested.

Why? Because clients think: ""Oh, this isn't some amateur. This
person knows what they're doing.""

Low prices signal low quality.

Instead, implement the strategy that's worked for me and hundreds
of students:

Raise your prices 30% for every equivalent project. Every single
time.

Example: If you just closed a client at $1,000, your next similar
project gets quoted at $1,300. The one after that? $1,700. And so
on.

""But Nick, what if they say no?""

Good. Let them say no.

Because after 5-6 clients say yes, you're now pitching 3-4x
higher prices than what you started with. You're having
conversations with serious buyers who have real budgets, not
tire-kickers asking you to ""match",2025-07-01T13:06:59+00:00,work,high,1,Respond or prepare deliverables,rule+llm_disagree,0.92,rule+llm_disagree,,

The shift had three parts:

He Targeted Instead of Sprayed: No more sending identical resumes everywher=

He Networked Proactively: Instead of waiting for responses that never came,=
 he reached out directly to employees at target companies. Not for jobs, bu=

Hi siddharthavasam,

Finance experts suggest that it's irresponsible to try to time the market.  
But in the age of machine learning, is it wrong not to try and time the  
market?

The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) would say everything knowable is  
already priced into a stock price. But how true is that theory?

In this competition, you'll use a combination of public and proprietary  
daily market data to build a model that predicts excess returns and powers  
a trading strategy that stays within a risk limit. Your work will test the  
Efficient Market Hypothesis and challenge assumptions about market  
efficiency.

198608d0d42a2e0b,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,This AI agent replaces graphic designers,"Hey - Nick here!

I wrote an in-depth article yesterday titled ""The next few months
of my life"". I include thoughts on the trajectory of my career,
ROI calculations, a breakdown of how I'm currently spending my
time, actionables, and more.

​You can check it out here. (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vu0zkn2drs9h9mrwq3ulhvmerk55fnhd2066/dpheh0he7qdqmkfm/aHR0cHM6Ly9uaWNrc2FyYWV2LmNvbS90aGUtbmV4dC1mZXctbW9udGhzLW9mLW15LWxpZmUv
)​

Now, let's get into today's email.

Back in 2020, I started a business called 1SecondPainting.

I stumbled on Gwern's This Anime Does Not Exist (
https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vu0zkn2drs9h9mrwq3ulhvmerk55fnhd2066/e0hph7h7nkmk2wc8/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhpc3dhaWZ1ZG9lc25vdGV4aXN0Lm5ldC9pbmRleC5odG1sP3JlZj1uaWNrc2FyYWV2LmNvbQ==
).

I decided my next step was to create a software application that
could generate impressive-looking images, and then sell those on
the Internet.

Took a pivot or two, but one night on a whim, I made a small web
app and posted it on Hacker News before I went to bed that night.

Shockingly, I went viral, hit #1 a few hours later, and by the
next afternoon, I had several dozen requests from labs, journals,
magazines, and companies to discuss the project.

""Roaring Sea"", one of my first generations back in 2020.
It peaked at ~$2,200 per month and I sold the site to a private
investor in the US the next year.

That was back in 2020.

A lot has changed since then.

-----------------------------------------------
Now, anyone can create art, visuals, and images
-----------------------------------------------

Many small businesses don’t need to hire graphic designers
anymore.

Others have graphic designers on staff, but they’ve become 10x
more effective.

Today’s workflow can help both kinds of businesses.

What we’ll cover:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it's structured/how it works
* You can grab the template for free

Let’s dive in.

During the course of the program over 465k in revenue was generated across 80k+ active users of these apps and over 50 projects secured investments.

19934d96f23952d0,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,How beginners charge high prices,"During last week’s community call, Doug shared something that
caught my attention.

He’d pitched $26,000 to a client he wasn’t even enjoying working
with, hoping they’d say no.

They said yes!

Then hired him for another $50,000.

Meanwhile, I know Maker School members building sophisticated
automation systems and charging $350.

Same skillset. Same market.

But 200x price difference!

Three specific fears keep people stuck pitching low prices:

---------------------------------------------------------
Fear #1: “Clients won’t tell me how much money they make”
---------------------------------------------------------

This fear is completely misguided.

Business owners live in spreadsheets. They track revenue, costs,
margins, growth rates, customer lifetime value. Numbers are their
language.

They’re not hiding their financials from you. They’re waiting for
you to prove you understand their business.

Wrong question: “How much revenue do you make?”

Right question: “If I could get you one more client like your
best client, what’s that worth?”

They’ll light up: “Our best clients pay $8,000 upfront and
typically stay for 18 months at $3k per month each, so that’s
about $59,000 in lifetime value.”

Business owners want ROI. They want to know the math works. Give
them a framework to see the value, and they’ll do the
calculations for you.

--------------------------------------------------
Fear #2: “What if I can’t deliver what I promise?”
--------------------------------------------------

Two solutions here:

Short-term: Make a guarantee.

If you don’t deliver the promised value, refund their money.
Simple.

Here’s the thing—you get paid either way:

* Deliver great results: You get paid money + learning
* Don’t deliver: You get paid in learning + reputation for
honesty

Most clients respect someone who stands behind their work more
than someone who hedges with weak guarantees.

Long-term: You just get be",2025-09-10T18:18:08+00:00,personal,medium,0,,llm,0.85,llm,,

From AI Anxiety to Career Advantage

You'll love this.

While everyone's panicking about AI stealing their jobs, a small group of p=
rofessionals just landed 40% salary increases.

Here's what they know that others don't:

AI isn't replacing jobs.
=C2=A0
It's creating premium, higher-paying versions of existing roles.

PwC's 2025 Global AI Jobs Barometer confirms it:=C2=A0

Wages are rising twice as fast in AI-exposed industries, with AI-skilled wo=
rkers earning premium salaries across every sector they analyzed.

But here's the twist most people miss...
=C2=A0
Most people assume you need to become an AI engineer or programmer to benef=
it from the AI boom.

Not true.

The biggest opportunities are going to professionals who become AI-enhanced=
 versions of what they already are.

Think about it: Companies don't just need AI builders.
=C2=A0
They need AI users who understand business context, customer needs, and ind=
ustry nuances.

That's where the real money is.

And it's happening in three distinct categories...

WONSULTING WISDOM

3 AI-Skills Categories Worth Premium Pay

These opportunities fall into three distinct skill categories that are alre=
ady reshaping the job market=F0=9F=91=87

1. Hybrid AI Integration
This is your fastest path to a raise.

- Data analysts are using AI for pattern recognition and automated reportin=
g
- Marketing professionals leverage AI for campaign optimization
They didn't abandon their expertise.
They amplified it.

The result? Skill requirements in AI-exposed roles are evolving 66% faster =
than last year.

This leads to urgent demand for professionals who can bridge AI capabilitie=
s with domain=C2=A0knowledge.

2. Human-AI Collaboration Mastery

1987a57f1ead1013,gmail,Wonsulting <hello@wonsulting.com>,💡$140K Marketing Roles + Land Offers in 120 Days (GUARANTEED),"[Shadow]

Something's Happening

Companies are quietly creating ""marketing"" roles that pay $140K+ to people =
with zero marketing experience.

These positions didn't exist two years ago.

Now they're everywhere.

Here's what we discovered=F0=9F=91=87
=C2=A0
=C2=A0

[Shadow]

Three Forces Created This Opportunity

Force #1: Low Talent Supply
=C2=A0
43% of marketers using AI don't know how to maximize its value, while 76% i=
dentify AI expertise as their biggest skills gap.=C2=B9

=C2=A0
Yet companies desperately need AI workflow builders, automation designers, =
and predictive marketing specialists.

- Marketing Data Scientists now average $156,000
- AI Marketing Strategists pull $148,000
- Growth Marketing Engineers command $142,000
But here's where it gets interesting...

=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Force #2: High Talent Demand

92% of executives expect to boost AI spending over the next three years.=C2=
=B2
=C2=A0
Microsoft's 2025 Work Trend Index reveals 28% of managers plan to hire AI w=
orkforce managers.

=C2=A0
AI experience isn't preferred anymore. It's required.

=C2=A0
Which created an unexpected twist...
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Force #3: Major Opportunity for Industry Outsiders

Traditional marketing skills are being commoditized. AI writes ad copy fast=
er. It analyzes data instantly.

But new premium skills emerged:

- AI workflow design.
- Human-AI collaboration.
- Custom automation.

Marketing veterans scramble to learn these skills. Meanwhile, AI-native pro=
fessionals can walk straight into senior roles.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Your Window of Opportunity
=C2=A0
While others fight over outdated positions, you can target tomorrow's jobs:

Target AI-first companies. Skip those ""exploring"" AI. Find ones implementin=
g it.

Develop hybrid skills. Technical ability plus marketing fundamentals.

=C2=A0
Focus on bridge roles. Marketing Operations Manager. Growth Marketing Engin=
eer. AI Strategy Specialist.
