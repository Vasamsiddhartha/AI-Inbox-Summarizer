1995ce50a602bb13,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,Stop manually researching prospects ($4k automation),"Today‚Äôs Client Ready Workflow is perfect for any business doing
outbound sales or lead research.

You‚Äôll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves

* You can grab the template for free

-----------------------
The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

I built this web scraping system for a marketing agency that was
burning 20+ hours per week on manual lead research.

Their process looked like this:

* Manually visit each prospect‚Äôs website
* Copy/paste information into spreadsheets
* Try to understand what each company does
* Write personalized email intros for each prospect
* Research competitors and industry details

Result: 20 hours of tedious work per week, inconsistent data
quality, and burned-out team members.

After implementing this automation:

Reduced research time from 20 hours to 30 minutes per week while
improving data quality and personalization.

Here‚Äôs exactly how it works, why every sales team needs this, and
how you can grab the templates for free.

-----------------------------
Why Companies Care About This
-----------------------------

Some relevant stats:

* 86% of buyers are willing to pay more for a great customer
experience (PwC)
* Personalized emails deliver 6x higher transaction rates than
generic emails (Experian)
* Sales teams spend only 33% of their time actually selling - the
rest is admin work (HubSpot)

What does this tell us?

That by automating research and personalizing outreach at scale,
you will close more deals faster while freeing up your team to
focus on actual selling.

--------------------
How The System Works

This system handles website analysis and complex real estate data
extraction.

Hi siddharthavasam,

Finance experts suggest that it's irresponsible to try to time the market.  
But in the age of machine learning, is it wrong not to try and time the  
market?

The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) would say everything knowable is  
already priced into a stock price. But how true is that theory?

In this competition, you'll use a combination of public and proprietary  
daily market data to build a model that predicts excess returns and powers  
a trading strategy that stays within a risk limit. Your work will test the  
Efficient Market Hypothesis and challenge assumptions about market  
efficiency.





Total Prizes:

$100,000

19952a109211a992,gmail,Wonsulting <hello@wonsulting.com>,üí°4 Tactics That Get You Hired (Not Your Resume),"[Shadow]

Are You Playing Your Job Search Right?

Hot take incoming =E2=98=84=EF=B8=8F

The hiring process isn't broken.=C2=A0
It's working exactly as designed.

It's just not designed for candidates =F0=9F=91=80

It's designed so hiring managers avoid making the wrong choice.

Think about it:=C2=A0

Why do you have to pass 5 interviews and a vibe check to be considered?
And why do companies take months to hire for ""urgent"" roles?

It=E2=80=99s because hiring managers don't get rewarded for hiring quickly.=
=C2=A0
They get punished for hiring wrong.

So they delay. They over-interview. They choose the ""safest"" candidate, not=
 necessarily the best one.
=C2=A0
This explains everything that frustrates you:

- Slow responses (they're checking with 5 other people)
- Weird interview processes (they're covering every possible risk)
- Ghosting after great interviews (someone got cold feet)
Now you have two choices here.
=C2=A0
You can keep expecting hiring to be logical, fair, and efficient
(sounds frustrating =F0=9F=98=85)
=C2=A0
Or you can accept the game and learn to play it strategically.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Here's how to play it strategically=F0=9F=91=87

=E2=80=8A

[Shadow]

Play the Game

The candidates who get hired aren't the most qualified.

They're the ones who understand hiring psychology.

Here are 4 tactics the best candidates use:
=C2=A0
=F0=9F=9A=A7 Become the safe choice=C2=A0
Show hiring managers how you reduce their risk. Craft a story that explains=
 why this move makes perfect sense right now. Hiring managers fear bad deci=
sions above most else. So eliminate their uncertainty with crystal-clear re=
asoning.
=C2=A0
=F0=9F=92=B0 Control the money conversation=C2=A0
Never discuss salary until there's an actual offer on the table. Use ""I'm c=
onfident we can work something out"" to deflect gracefully. Early salary tal=
k kills more opportunities than bad interviews do.

Hey builders,

The world‚Äôs best coding agents are coming to Bolt.

You‚Äôve told us what‚Äôs been holding vibe coding (and tools like ours) back: endless error loops, half-wired backends, and prototypes that never reach production. We‚Äôre announcing the first step toward Bolt V2 today on X (https://d5llC804.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DQ+113/d5llC804/VX7J128Y4NHLW4ZnDg23Y0mT0W2L--MX5CfHP4N7Cq3xb3lcq-W7lCdLW6lZ3kxW8qPh3D4JS1V3W5rNw4K2lykhGW61pK4n1FmWVxW5X_7cr8BGSrXW1YmJkf4ZghVMW8Xc1-f5MyT2DW2H2xB27W9blWW3qrmWC788b0QW4WFBDK3HsCL0N8vTRlZPDT4ZW3rgXpD5lR8QQW2vFTfB5tg5_qW6mcJbm2B1GgXW4jw0zP5zz_MxV4hWpY6T67ygM1wxK_G3SnhW8LNh7z6rZTpqW8YHWKM3CHXCtW7KgV2V8VWsPYW28sZDY6pkslpW4PFp0g8KRYTgVpQmF47F-hrwN7DCCj0DhBzkW7b0zmW9jTQ1xf7m3hPW04 ) .

We‚Äôve been listening. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre bringing Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini CLI, the world‚Äôs best coding agents, into Bolt:

- No more error loops

- Build beyond prototypes

- Enterprise-ready products, right in your browser

And this is just the beginning. Claude Code is the first step toward Bolt V2, our biggest launch ever, coming later this month. Our community will be the first to test what‚Äôs next.

Hi siddharthavasam,

The OpenAI to Z Hackathon proved what happens when thousands of Kagglers  
tackle a challenge with creativity, collaboration and data.

In this hackathon, over 8,000 Kagglers became modern-day digital explorers,  
using open data and AI models to uncover secrets of the Amazon rainforest  
and bring ancient legends to life. Some teams focused on predicting hidden  
archaeological sites, others experimented with new patterns in the data and  
a few surprised us with entirely new approaches to discovery.

There were more than 200 submissions, each representing a unique way to  
explore a complex problem. Hackathons like this aren't just about accuracy  
- they're about imagination, experimentation and collaboration. They create  
a portfolio of creative solutions, showing what's possible when communities  
come together to explore a challenge from different angles.

The winning teams and projects have been announced, but the creativity and  
insights from all participants continue to inspire. You can explore all the  
writeups from the participants to see the wide range of ideas and  
approaches.





Explore Writeups



Your digital exploration continues! Kaggle will keep offering new  
hackathons to test ideas, collaborate and discover what's possible together.

Happy Kaggling!

19915b0b7363a55a,gmail,Nick Saraev <nick@leftclick.ai>,Google Sheets to blog in 3 minutes (sell for $4k),"Today‚Äôs Client Ready Workflow addresses something every content
team is dealing with right now.

You‚Äôll get:

* A workflow breakdown
* The problem it solves
* How it‚Äôs structured/how it works
* A template you can grab for free (and sell to your own clients)

Let‚Äôs dive in.

I built an AI-powered content publishing system for a digital
marketing agency that had a massive problem:

They were spending 15-20 hours per week manually formatting,
optimizing, and publishing content that was already written.

The result:

Reduced content publishing time from 45 minutes per article to
under 3 minutes while improving SEO consistency.

Here‚Äôs exactly how it works, why every content-heavy business
needs this, and how you can grab the template for free.

The Problem This Solves
-----------------------

Picture this scenario that‚Äôs playing out at thousands of
companies right now:

Your content team writes amazing articles. They‚Äôre stored in
Google Docs, planned in spreadsheets, but getting them live on
WordPress is a nightmare.

Each article requires:

* Manual HTML formatting (headings, lists, paragraphs)
* SEO excerpt creation
* WordPress slug optimization
* Publishing workflow management
* Quality control checks

Some brutal stats about content publishing inefficiency:

* 73% of content teams report that manual publishing workflows
are their biggest bottleneck (Content Marketing Institute)
* Average time per article: 45-60 minutes of formatting and
publishing work
* Error rate: 23% of manually published articles contain
formatting errors that hurt SEO

What does this tell us?

If you‚Äôre not using AI to automate content publishing, you‚Äôre
already behind.

While your competitors are manually copying and pasting content,
smart companies are using AI to publish content at 10x speed with
better consistency.

How The System Works
